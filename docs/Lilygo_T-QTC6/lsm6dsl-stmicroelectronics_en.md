Application note
## LSM6DSL: always-on 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope

**Introduction**

[This document is intended to provide usage information and application hints related to ST’s LSM6DSL iNEMO inertial module.](https://www.st.com/en/product/lsm6dsl)

The LSM6DSL is a 3D digital accelerometer and 3D digital gyroscope system-in-package with a digital I [2] C/SPI serial interface
standard output, performing at 0.65 mA in combo High-Performance mode. Thanks to the ultra-low noise performance of both
the gyroscope and the accelerometer, the device combines always-on low-power features with superior sensing precision for an
optimal motion experience for the consumer. Furthermore, the accelerometer features smart sleep-to-wake-up (Activity) and
return-to-sleep (Inactivity) functions that allow advanced power saving.

The device has a dynamic user-selectable full-scale acceleration range of ±2/±4/±8/±16 *g* and an angular rate range of
±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000 dps.

The LSM6DSL can be configured to generate interrupt signals by using hardware recognition of free-fall events, 6D orientation,
tap and double-tap sensing, activity or inactivity, and wake-up events.

The availability of a dedicated connection mode to external sensors allows the implementation of the sensor hub functionality.

The LSM6DSL is compatible with the requirements of the leading OSs, offering real, virtual and batch-mode sensors. It has
been designed to implement in hardware significant motion, relative tilt, absolute wrist tilt, pedometer functions, timestamp and
to support the data acquisition of an external magnetometer with ironing correction (hard, soft).

The LSM6DSL has an integrated smart first-in first-out (FIFO) buffer of up to 4 Kbyte size, allowing dynamic batching of
significant data (i.e. external sensors, step counter, timestamp and temperature).

The LSM6DSL is available in a small plastic land grid array package (LGA-14L) and it is guaranteed to operate over an
extended temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C.

The ultra-small size and weight of the SMD package make it an ideal choice for handheld portable applications such as
smartphones, IoT connected devices, and wearables or any other application where reduced package size and weight are
required.

**Operating modes**
## **3 Operating modes**

The LSM6DSL provides three possible operating configurations:

         - only accelerometer active and gyroscope in Power-Down;

         - only gyroscope active and accelerometer in Power-Down;

         - both accelerometer and gyroscope active with independent ODR.

The device offers a wide VDD voltage range from 1.71 V to 3.6 V and a VDDIO range from 1.62 V to 3.6 V. In
order to avoid potential conflicts, during the power-on sequence it is recommended to set the lines connected to
the the device IO pins to high-impedance state on the host side. Furthermore, to guarantee proper power-off of
the device it is recommended to maintain the duration of the VDD line to GND for at least 100 µs.

After the power supply is applied, the LSM6DSL performs a 15 ms boot procedure to load the trimming
parameters. After the boot is completed, both the accelerometer and the gyroscope are automatically configured
in Power-Down mode.

The accelerometer and the gyroscope can be independently configured in four different power modes: PowerDown, Low-Power, Normal and High-Performance mode. They are allowed to have different data rates without
any limit. The gyroscope sensor can also be set in Sleep mode to reduce its power consumption.

When both the accelerometer and gyroscope are on, the accelerometer is synchronized with the gyroscope, and
the data rates of the two sensors are integer multiples of each other.

Referring to the LSM6DSL datasheet, the output data rate (ODR_XL) bits of the CTRL1_XL register and the HighPerformance disable (XL_HM_MODE) bit of the CTRL6_C register are used to select the power mode and the
output data rate of the accelerometer (Table 5. Accelerometer ODR and power mode selection).

**Table 5. Accelerometer ODR and power mode selection**





|ODR_XL [3:0]|ODR [Hz] when<br>XL_HM_MODE = 1|ODR [Hz] when<br>XL_HM_MODE = 0|
|---|---|---|
|0000|Power Down|Power Down|
|1011|1.6 Hz (Low Power only)|12.5 Hz (High Performance)|

|1010|6.66 kHz (High Performance)|6.66 kHz (High Performance)|


The output data rate (ODR_G) bits of the CTRL2_G register and the High-Performance disable (G_HM_MODE)
bit of the CTRL7_G register are used to select the power mode and output data rate of the gyroscope sensor
(Table 6. Gyroscope ODR and power mode selection).

**Power-Down mode**

**3.1** **Power-Down mode**

When the accelerometer/gyroscope is in Power-Down mode, almost all internal blocks of the device are switched
off to minimize power consumption. The digital interfaces (I [2] C and SPI) are still active to allow communication
with the device. The content of the configuration registers is preserved and the output data registers are not
updated, keeping the last data sampled in memory before going into Power-Down mode.

**3.2** **High-Performance mode**

In High-Performance mode, all accelerometer/gyroscope circuitry is always on and data are generated at the data
rate selected through the ODR_XL/ODR_G bits.

Data interrupt generation is active.

**3.3** **Normal mode**

While High-Performance mode guarantees the best performance in terms of noise, Normal mode further reduces
the current consumption. The accelerometer/gyroscope data reading chain is automatically turned on and off to
save power. In the gyroscope device, only the driving circuitry is always on.

Data interrupt generation is active.

**3.4** **Low-Power mode**

Low-Power mode differs from Normal mode in the available output data rates. In Low-Power mode low-speed
ODRs are enabled. Four low-speed ODRs can be chosen for the accelerometer through the ODR_XL bits: 1.6
Hz, 12.5 Hz, 26 Hz and 52 Hz. Three low-speed ODRs can be chosen for the gyroscope thorough the ODR_G
bits: 12.5 Hz, 26 Hz and 52 Hz.

Data interrupt generation is active.

**3.5** **Gyroscope Sleep mode**

While the gyroscope is in Sleep mode the circuitry that drives the oscillation of the gyroscope mass is kept active.
Compared to gyroscope Power-Down, turn-on time from Sleep mode to Low-Power/Normal/High-Performance
mode is drastically reduced.

If the gyroscope is not configured in Power-Down mode, it enters in Sleep mode when the Sleep mode enable
(SLEEP) bit of the CTRL4_C register is set to 1, regardless of the selected gyroscope ODR.

**3.6** **Connection modes**

The LSM6DSL offers two different connection modes, described in detail in this document:

         - **Mode 1:** it is the connection mode enabled by default; I [2] C slave interface or SPI (3- / 4-wire) serial interface
is available. When the device is configured in connection Mode 1, the SCx/SDx pins cannot be left floating.
It's recommended to connect both of them to VDDIO in order to optimize power consumption during the
device start-up sequence.

         - **Mode 2:** it is the sensor hub mode; I [2] C slave interface or SPI (3- / 4-wire) serial interface and I [2] C interface
master for external sensor connections are available. This connection mode is described in Section 7 Mode

2 - Sensor hub mode.

**Accelerometer bandwidth**

**3.7** **Accelerometer bandwidth**

The accelerometer sampling chain is represented by a cascade of four main blocks: an analog anti-aliasing lowpass filter, an ADC converter, a digital low-pass filter and the composite group of digital filters.

As shown in Figure 2. Accelerometer filtering chain, the analog signal coming from the mechanical parts is filtered
by an analog low-pass anti-aliasing filter before being converted by the ADC. The anti-aliasing filter is enabled in
High-Performance mode only and its bandwidth depends on the selected accelerometer ODR as shown in the
following table.

**Table 8. Accelerometer analog filter bandwidth**

|Accelerometer ODR [Hz]|Analog filter BW [Hz]|
|---|---|
|≥ 1666|1500|
|< 1666|400|



The analog filter bandwidth can be set to 400 Hz also for accelerometer ODR ≥ 1666 Hz by setting the BW0_XL
bit to 1 in the CTRL1_XL register.

The digital LPF1 filter provides two outputs having different cutoff frequencies from each other; the desired LPF1
output can be selected through the LPF1_BW_SEL bit in the CTRL1_XL register and the INPUT_COMPOSITE bit
in the CTRL8_XL register.

**Figure 2. Accelerometer filtering chain**

Referring to Figure 2. Accelerometer filtering chain, the cutoff frequency of the “ODR/2” output of the LPF1 filter is
equal to ODR/2 in High-Performance mode and it is equal to 740 Hz in Low Power / Normal modes. The cutoff
frequency of the “ODR/4” output is always equal to ODR/4, regardless of the selected power mode. The smart
functions block in these figures refer to pedometer, step detector and step counter, significant motion and tilt
functions described in Section 6 Embedded functions .

**AN5040**

**Accelerometer bandwidth**

Finally, the composite group of filters composed of a low-pass digital filter (LPF2), a high-pass digital filter and a
slope filter processes the digital signal.

The CTRL8_XL register can be used to configure the composite filter group and the overall bandwidth of the
accelerometer filtering chain, as shown in Table 9. Accelerometer bandwidth selection. Referring to this table, on
the low-pass path side, the Bandwidth column refers to the LPF1 bandwidth if LPF2_XL_EN = 0; it refers to the
LPF2 bandwidth if LPF2_XL_EN = 1. On the high-pass path side, the Bandwidth column refers to the Slope filter
bandwidth if HPCF_XL[1:0] = 00b; it refers to the HP filter bandwidth if HPCF_XL[1:0] = 01b / 10b / 11b.

Table 9. Accelerometer bandwidth selection also provides the maximum (worst case) settling time in terms of
samples to be discarded for the various configurations of the accelerometer filtering chain. Further details are
described in Section 3.9 Accelerometer and gyroscope turn-on/off time.

**Table 9. Accelerometer bandwidth selection**













|HP_SLOPE_XL_EN|LPF2_XL_EN|LPF1_BW_SEL|HPCF_XL[1:0]|INPUT_ COMPOSITE|Bandwidth|Max. overall settling time (1)<br>(samples to be discarded)|

|0<br>(Low-Pass path)|0|0|-|-|ODR/2|14|
|0<br>(Low-Pass path)|0|1|-|-|ODR/4|14|
|0<br>(Low-Pass path)|1|-|00|1 (low noise)<br>0 (low latency)|ODR/50|40|
|0<br>(Low-Pass path)|1|-|01|01|ODR/100|80|
|0<br>(Low-Pass path)|1|-|10|10|ODR/9|15|

|1<br>(High-Pass path)|-|-|11|11|ODR/400|320|


*1.* *Settling time @ 99% of the final value*

Setting the HP_SLOPE_XL_EN bit to 0, the low-pass path of the composite filter block is selected. If the
LPF2_XL_EN bit is set to 0, no additional filter is applied; if the LPF2_XL_EN bit is set to 1, the LPF2 filter is
applied in addition to LPF1 and the overall bandwidth of the accelerometer chain can be set by configuring the
HPCF_XL[1:0] field of the CTRL8_XL register.

The LPF2 low-pass filter can also be used in the 6D/4D functionality by setting the LOW_PASS_ON_6D bit of the
CTRL8_XL register to 1.

Setting the HP_SLOPE_XL_EN bit to 1, the high-pass path of the composite filter block is selected: the
HPCF_XL[1:0] field is used in order to enable, in addition to the LPF1 filter, either the Slope filter usage (when
HPCF_XL[1:0] = 00b) or the digital high-pass filter (other HPCF_XL[1:0] configurations). The HPCF_XL[1:0] field
is also used to select the cutoff frequencies of the HP filter.

The reference mode feature is available for the accelerometer sensor: when this feature is enabled, the current X,
Y, Z accelerometer sample is internally stored and subtracted from all subsequent output values. In order to
enable the reference mode, both the HP_REF_MODE bit and the HP_SLOPE_XL_EN bit of the CTRL8_XL
register have to be set to 1, and the value of the HPCF_XL[1:0] field has to be different than 00b. When the
reference mode feature is enabled, both the LPF2 filter and the HP filter are not available. The first accelerometer
output data after enabling the reference mode has to be discarded.

**Accelerometer bandwidth**

**3.7.1** **Accelerometer slope filter**

As shown in Figure 2. Accelerometer filtering chain, the LSM6DSL device embeds a digital Slope filter, which can
also be used for some embedded features such as single/double-tap recognition, wake-up detection and activity/
inactivity.

The slope filter output data is calculated using the following formula:

slope(t n ) = [acc(t n ) - acc(t n-1 )]/2

An example of a slope data signal is illustrated in Figure 3. Accelerometer slope filter.

**Gyroscope bandwidth**

**3.8** **Gyroscope bandwidth**

In the LSM6DSL device, the gyroscope filtering chain depends on the connection mode in use.

The gyroscope filtering chain configuration is shown in Figure 4. Gyroscope digital chain). It is a cascade of three
filters: a selectable digital high-pass filter (HPF), a selectable digital low-pass filter (LPF1) and a digital low-pass
filter (LPF2).

**Figure 4. Gyroscope digital chain**













**FTYPE[1:0]**

The digital HP filter can be enabled by setting the HP_EN_G bit of the CTRL7_G register to 1. The digital HP filter
cutoff frequency can be selected through the field HPM_G[1:0] of the CTRL7_G register, according to the table
below.

*Note: The embedded HP filter is available in High-Performance mode only. If the gyroscope is configured in Low-*
*Power / Normal mode, the high-pass filter is bypassed regardless of the configuration of the HP_G_EN bit of*
*CTRL7_G register.*

**Table 10. Gyroscope digital HP filter cutoff selection**

|HPM_G[1:0]|High-pass filter cutoff frequency [Hz]|
|---|---|
|00|0.016|
|01|0.065|
|10|0.260|
|11|1.040|



The digital LPF1 filter can be enabled by setting the LPF1_SEL_G bit of CTRL4_C register to 1 and its bandwidth
can be selected through the field FTYPE_[1:0] of the CTRL6_C register.

*Note: The digital LPF1 filter is available in High-Performance mode only. If the gyroscope is configured in Low-*
*Power / Normal mode, the LPF1 filter is bypassed regardless of the configuration of the LPF1_SEL_G bit of*
*CTRL4_C register.*

The digital LPF2 filter cannot be configured by the user (regardless of the selected power mode) and its cutoff
frequency depends on the selected gyroscope ODR. When the gyroscope ODR is equal to 6.66 kHz, the LPF2
filter is bypassed.

The overall gyroscope bandwidth for different configurations of the LPF1_SEL_G bit of the CTRL4_C register and
FTYPE_[1:0] of the CTRL6_C register is summarized in the following table.

**3.9** **Accelerometer and gyroscope turn-on/off time**

The accelerometer reading chain contains low-pass filtering to improve signal-to-noise performance and to reduce
aliasing effects. For this reason, it is necessary to take into account the settling time of the filters when the
accelerometer power mode is switched or when the accelerometer ODR is changed.

The maximum overall turn-on/off time (with LPF2 and HP filters disabled) in order to switch accelerometer power
modes or accelerometer ODR is shown in Table 12. Accelerometer turn-on/off time (LPF2 and HP disabled)

*Note: The accelerometer ODR timing is not impacted by power mode changes (a new configuration is effective*
*after the completion of the current period).*

**Mode 1 - Reading output data**
## **4 Mode 1 - Reading output data**

**4.1** **Startup sequence**

Once the device is powered up, it automatically downloads the calibration coefficients from the embedded flash to
the internal registers. When the boot procedure is completed, i.e. after approximately 15 milliseconds, the
accelerometer and gyroscope automatically enter Power-Down mode.

To turn on the accelerometer and gather acceleration data, it is necessary to select one of the operating modes
through the CTRL1_XL register.

The following general-purpose sequence can be used to configure the accelerometer:

1. Write CTRL1_XL = 60h // Acc = 416 Hz (High-Performance mode)

2. Write INT1_CTRL = 01h // Acc data-ready interrupt on INT1

To turn on the gyroscope and gather angular rate data, it is necessary to select one of the operating modes
through CTRL2_G.

The following general-purpose sequence can be used to configure the gyroscope:

1. Write CTRL2_G = 60h // Gyro = 416 Hz (High-Performance mode)

2. Write INT1_CTRL = 02h // Gyro data-ready interrupt on INT1

**4.2** **Using the status register**

The device is provided with a STATUS_REG register which should be polled to check when a new set of data is
available. The XLDA bit is set to 1 when a new set of data is available at accelerometer output; the GDA bit is set
to 1 when a new set of data is available at gyroscope output.

For the accelerometer (the gyroscope is similar), the read of the output registers should be performed as follows:

1. Read STATUS

2. If XLDA = 0, then go to 1

3. Read OUTX_L_XL

4. Read OUTX_H_XL

5. Read OUTY_L_XL

6. Read OUTY_H_XL

7. Read OUTZ_L_XL

8. Read OUTZ_H_XL

9. Data processing

10. Go to 1

**AN5040**

**Using the data-ready signal**

**4.3** **Using the data-ready signal**

The device can be configured to have one HW signal to determine when a new set of measurement data is
available to be read.

For the accelerometer sensor, the data-ready signal is represented by the XLDA bit of the STATUS_REG register.
The signal can be driven to the INT1 pin by setting the INT1_DRDY_XL bit of the INT1_CTRL register to 1 and to
the INT2 pin by setting the INT2_DRDY_XL bit of the INT2_CTRL register to 1.

For the gyroscope sensor, the data-ready signal is represented by the GDA bit of the STATUS_REG register. The
signal can be driven to the INT1 pin by setting the INT1_DRDY_G bit of the INT1_CTRL register to 1 and to the
INT2 pin by setting the INT2_DRDY_G bit of the INT2_CTRL register to 1.

The data-ready signal rises to 1 when a new set of data has been generated and it is available to be read. The
data-ready signal can be either latched or pulsed: if the DRDY_PULSED bit of the DRDY_PULSE_CFG register is
set to 0 (default value), then the data-ready signal is latched and the interrupt is reset when the higher part of one
of the enabled channels is read (29h, 2Bh, 2Dh for the accelerometer; 23h, 25h, 27h for the gyroscope). If the
DRDY_PULSED bit of the DRDY_PULSE_CFG register is set to 1, then the data-ready is pulsed and the duration
of the pulse observed on the interrupt pins is 75 µs. Pulsed mode is not applied to the XLDA and GDA bits which
are always latched.

**Figure 5. Data-ready signal**

**4.3.1** **DRDY mask functionality**

Setting the DRDY_MASK bit of the CTRL4_C register to 1, the accelerometer and gyroscope data-ready signals
are masked until the settling of the sensor filters is completed.

When FIFO is active and the DRDY_MASK bit is set to 1, accelerometer/gyroscope invalid samples stored in
FIFO can be equal to 7FFFh, 7FFEh or 7FFDh. In this way, a tag is applied to the invalid samples stored in the
FIFO buffer so that they can be easily identified and discarded during data post-processing.

*Note: The DRDY_MASK bit acts only on the accelerometer LPF1 and the gyroscope LPF2 digital filters settling*
*time.*

**AN5040**

**Using the block data update (BDU) feature**

**4.4** **Using the block data update (BDU) feature**

If reading the accelerometer/gyroscope data is particularly slow and cannot be synchronized (or it is not required)
with either the XLDA/GDA bits in the STATUS_REG register or with the DRDY signal driven to the INT1/INT2
pins, it is strongly recommended to set the BDU (Block Data Update) bit to 1 in the CTRL3_C register.

This feature avoids reading values (most significant and least significant parts of output data) related to different
samples. In particular, when the BDU is activated, the data registers related to each channel always contain the
most recent output data produced by the device, but, in case the read of a given pair (i.e. OUTX_H_XL(G) and
OUTX_L_XL(G), OUTY_H_XL(G) and OUTY_L_XL(G), OUTZ_H_XL(G) and OUTZ_L_XL(G)) is initiated, the
refresh for that pair is blocked until both MSB and LSB parts of the data are read.

*Note: BDU only guarantees that the LSB part and MSB part have been sampled at the same moment. For*
*example, if the reading speed is too slow, X and Y can be read at T1 and Z sampled at T2* .

**4.5** **Understanding output data**

The measured acceleration data are sent to the OUTX_H_XL, OUTX_L_XL, OUTY_H_XL, OUTY_L_XL,
OUTZ_H_XL, and OUTZ_L_XL registers. These registers contain, respectively, the most significant part and the
least significant part of the acceleration signals acting on the X, Y, and Z axes.

The measured angular rate data are sent to the OUTX_H_G, OUTX_L_G, OUTY_H_G, OUTY_L_G, OUTZ_H_G,
and OUTZ_L_G registers. These registers contain, respectively, the most significant part and the least significant
part of the angular rate signals acting on the X, Y, and Z axes.

The complete output data for the X, Y, Z channels is given by the concatenation OUTX_H_XL(G) &
OUTX_L_XL(G), OUTY_H_XL(G) & OUTY_L_XL(G), OUTZ_H_XL(G) & OUTZ_L_XL(G) and it is expressed as
a two’s complement number.

Both acceleration data and angular rate data are represented as 16-bit numbers.

**4.5.1** **Big-little endian selection**

The LSM6DSL allows swapping the content of the lower and the upper part of the output data registers (i.e.
OUTX_H_XL(G) with OUTX_L_XL(G), and OUT_TEMP_H with OUT_TEMP_L) in order to be compliant with both
little-endian and big-endian data representations.

“Little Endian” means that the low-order byte of the number is stored in memory at the lowest address, and the
high-order byte at the highest address. This mode corresponds to the BLE bit of the CTRL3_C register set to 0
(default configuration).

On the contrary, “Big Endian” means that the high-order byte of the number is stored in memory at the lowest
address, and the low-order byte at the highest address. This mode corresponds to the BLE bit of the CTRL3_C
register set to 1.

**Accelerometer offset registers**

**4.5.2** **Examples of output data**

Table 17. Output data registers content vs. acceleration (FS_XL = ±2 *g* ) provides a few basic examples of the
accelerometer data that is read in the data registers when the device is subject to a given acceleration.

Table 18. Output data registers content vs. angular rate (FS_G = ±250 dps) provides a few basic examples of the
gyroscope data that is read in the data registers when the device is subject to a given angular rate.

The values listed in the following tables are given under the hypothesis of perfect device calibration (i.e. no offset,
no gain error,....) and practically show the effect of the BLE bit.

**4.6** **Accelerometer offset registers**

The LSM6DSL provides the accelerometer offset registers (X_OFS_USR, Y_OFS_USR, Z_OFS_USR) which can
be used for zero-g offset correction or, in general, to apply an offset to the accelerometer output data.

The offset value set in the offset registers is internally subtracted from the measured acceleration value for the Zaxis, and it is internally added to the measured acceleration value for the X and Y axes; internally processed data
are then sent to the accelerometer output register and to the FIFO (if enabled). These registers values are
expressed as an 8-bit word in two’s complement and must be in the range [-127, 127].

The weight [ *g* /LSB] to be applied to the offset register values is independent of the accelerometer selected fullscale and can be configured using the USR_OFF_W bit of the CTRL6_C register:

         - 2 [-10] *g* /LSB if the USR_OFF_W bit is set to 0;

         - 2 [-6] *g* /LSB if the USR_OFF_W bit is set to 1.

**AN5040**

**Rounding functions**

**4.7** **Rounding functions**

The rounding function can be used to auto address the LSM6DSL registers for a circular burst-mode read.
Basically, with a multiple read operation the address of the register that is being read goes automatically from the
first register to the last register of the pattern and then goes back to the first one.

**4.7.1** **Rounding of FIFO output registers**

The rounding function is automatically enabled when performing a multiple read operation of the FIFO output
registers FIFO_DATA_OUT_L (3Eh) and FIFO_DATA_OUT_H (3Fh).

**4.7.2** **Rounding of source registers**

It is possible to apply the rounding function also to the source registers of the LSM6DSL device, in order to verify
with one multiple read whether new data was generated or a new interrupt event was detected.

The rounding function on the source registers can be enabled by setting the ROUNDING_STATUS bit of the
CTRL7_G register to 1. When this function is enabled, with a multiple read operation the address of the register
that is being read cycles automatically on WAKE_UP_SRC(1Bh), TAP_SRC(1Ch), D6D_SRC(1Dh),
STATUS_REG (1Eh) and FUNC_SRC1 (53h) and goes back to WAKE_UP_SRC (1Bh).

**4.7.3** **Rounding of sensor output registers**

The rounding function can also be enabled for the following groups of output registers:

         - Gyroscope output registers, from OUTX_L_G (22h) to OUTZ_H_G (27h);

         - Accelerometer output registers, from OUTX_L_XL (28h) to OUTZ_H_XL (2Dh);

         - First group of sensor hub output registers, from SENSORHUB1_REG (2Eh) to SENSORHUB6_REG (33h);

         - Second group of sensor hub output registers, from SENSORHUB7_REG (34h) to SENSORHUB12_REG
(39h).

The output registers rounding pattern can be configured using the bits ROUNDING[2:0] of the CTRL5_C register,
as indicated in Table 19. Output registers rounding pattern.

**Table 19. Output registers rounding pattern**




|ROUNDING[2:0]|Rounding pattern|
|---|---|
|000|No rounding|
|001|Accelerometer only|
|010|Gyroscope only|
|011|Gyroscope + Accelerometer|
|100|1st group of Sensor Hub only|

**Edge-sensitive and level-sensitive data enable (DEN)**

**4.8** **Edge-sensitive and level-sensitive data enable (DEN)**

The LSM6DSL allows an external trigger level recognition through enabling the TRIG_EN, LVL1_EN, LVL2_EN
bits in CTRL6_C.

Four different modes can be selected (Table 20. DEN configurations):

         - Edge-sensitive trigger mode

         - Level-sensitive trigger mode

         - Level-sensitive latched mode

         - Level-sensitive FIFO enable mode

The Data Enable (DEN) input signal is driven on the INT2 pin, which is configured as an input pin when one of the
trigger modes is enabled.

The DEN functionality is active by default on the gyroscope data only. To extend this feature to the accelerometer
data, the bit DEN_XL_EN in CTRL4_C must be set to 1.

The DEN active level is low by default. It can be changed to active-high by setting the bit DEN_LH in CTRL5_C to
1.

**Table 20. DEN configurations**

|TRIG_EN|LVL1_EN|LVL2_EN|Function|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|0|0|Edge-sensitive trigger mode|
|0|1|0|Level-sensitive trigger mode|
|0|1|1|Level-sensitive latched mode|
|1|1|0|Level-sensitive FIFO enable mode|



**4.8.1** **Edge-sensitive trigger mode**

Edge-sensitive trigger mode can be enabled by setting the TRIG_EN bit in CTRL6_C to 1, and LVL1_EN,
LVL2_EN bits in CTRL6_C to 0.

The edge-sensitive trigger works only when the low-pass filter LPF2 is disabled (LPF2_XL_EN = 0 in CTRL8_XL
register).

Once the edge-sensitive trigger mode is enabled, the FIFO buffer and output registers are filled with the first
sample acquired after every rising edge (if DEN_LH bit is equal to 1) or falling edge (if DEN_LH bit is equal to 0)
of the DEN input signal.

**Edge-sensitive and level-sensitive data enable (DEN)**

**Figure 6. Edge-sensitive trigger mode, DEN active low**

Edge-sensitive trigger mode, when enabled, acts only on the gyroscope output registers. The DRDY_G is related
only to downsampled data, while the accelerometer output registers and DRDY_XL are updated according to
ODR_XL. If the DEN_XL_EN bit is set to 1, the accelerometer sensor is downsampled too. In this case, the
gyroscope and accelerometer have to be set in combo mode at the same ODR. The accelerometer standalone
mode could be used by setting the gyroscope in Power-Down. In this case, DRDY_XL relates to downsampled
data only.

Please note that the DEN trigger is internally latched before the update of the data registers: if a trigger occurs
after this event, DEN will be acknowledged in the next ODR.

There are three possible configurations for the edge-sensitive trigger in FIFO, described below:

1. **Only gyroscope in trigger mode but not saved in FIFO:** in this case, FIFO is related only to the
accelerometer and works as usual.

2. **Only gyroscope in trigger mode and saved in FIFO:** in this case the gyroscope decimation bits
DEC_FIFO_GYRO [2:0] of the FIFO_CTRL3 register have to be set to 001 (gyroscope sensor in FIFO
without decimation). Doing this, FIFO is driven by an external trigger. With this configuration, since also
accelerometer data is written when the trigger occurs, possible repetition or loss of data for the
accelerometer may occur.

3. **Gyroscope and accelerometer in trigger mode and saved in FIFO:** this configuration can be used by
setting DEN_XL_EN to 1 and the gyroscope and accelerometer decimation bits DEC_FIFO_GYRO [2:0] and
DEC_FIFO_XL [2:0] of the FIFO_CTRL3 register to 001 (gyroscope and accelerometers in FIFO without
decimation). In this case, data of both sensors are written in FIFO when trigger occurs.

Edge-sensitive trigger mode allows, for example, the synchronization of the camera frames with the samples
coming from the gyroscope for Electrical Image Stabilization (EIS) applications. The synchronization signal from
the camera module must be connected to the INT2 pin.

In the example shown below, the FIFO has been configured to store both the gyroscope data and the
accelerometer data in the FIFO buffer; when the DEN signal toggles, the data are written to FIFO on the rising
edge.

1. Write 09h to FIFO_CTRL3 // Enable gyroscope and accelerometer in FIFO (no decimation)

2. Write 26h to FIFO_CTRL5 // Set FIFO in Continuous mode, FIFO ODR = 104 Hz


3. Write 80h to CTRL6_C


// Enable the edge-sensitive trigger

// INT2 pin is switched to input mode (DEN signal)


4. Write 80h to CTRL4_C // Extend DEN functionality to accelerometer sensor

5. Write 40h to CTRL1_XL // Turn on the accelerometer: ODR_XL = 104 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*


6. Write 4Ch to CTRL2_G


// Turn on the gyroscope

// ODR_G = 104 Hz, FS_G = ±2000 dps

**Edge-sensitive and level-sensitive data enable (DEN)**

**4.8.2** **Level-sensitive trigger mode**

Level-sensitive trigger mode can be enabled by setting the LVL1_EN bit in CTRL6_C to 1, and the TRIG_EN,
LVL2_EN bits in CTRL6_C to 0.

Once the level-sensitive trigger mode is enabled, the LSB bit of the selected data (in output registers and FIFO) is
replaced by 1 if the DEN level is active, or 0 if the DEN level is not active. The selected data can be the X, Y, Z
axes of the accelerometer or gyroscope sensor, defined through the DEN_X, DEN_Y, DEN_Z, DEN_XL_G bits in
CTRL9_XL.

All data can be stored in the FIFO according to the FIFO settings.

Figure 7. Level-sensitive trigger mode, DEN active low shows with red circles the samples stored in the FIFO with
LSB = 0 (DEN not active) and with blue circles the samples stored in the FIFO with LSB = 1 (DEN active).

**Figure 7. Level-sensitive trigger mode, DEN active low**

When the level-sensitive trigger mode is enabled, the DEN signal can also be used to filter the data-ready signal
on the INT1 pin. INT1 will show data-ready information only when the DEN pin is in the active state. To do this,
the bit DEN_DRDY_INT1 of the CTRL4_C register must be set to 1. The interrupt signal can be latched or pulsed
according to the DRDY_PULSED bit of the DRDY_PULSE_CFG register.

Figure 8. Level-sensitive trigger mode, DEN active low, DEN_DRDY on INT1 shows an example of data-ready on
INT1 when the DEN level is low (active state).

**Edge-sensitive and level-sensitive data enable (DEN)**

**4.8.3** **Level-sensitive latched mode**

Level-sensitive latched mode can be enabled by setting the LVL1_EN and LVL2_EN bits in CTRL6_C to 1, and
the TRIG_EN bit in CTRL6_C to 0.

When the level-sensitive latched mode is enabled, the LSB bit of the selected data (in output registers and FIFO)
is normally set to 0 and becomes 1 only on the first sample after a pulse on the DEN pin.

Data can be selected through the DEN_X, DEN_Y, DEN_Z, DEN_XL_G bits in CTRL9_XL.

Figure 9. Level-sensitive latched mode, DEN active low shows an example of level-sensitive latched mode with
DEN active low. After the pulse on the DEN pin, the sample with a red circle will have the value 1 on the LSB bit.
All the other samples will have LSB bit 0.

**Figure 9. Level-sensitive latched mode, DEN active low**

When the level-sensitive latched mode is enabled and the bit DEN_DRDY_INT1 of the CTRL4_C register is set to
1, a pulse is generated on INT1 pin in corresponding to the availability of the first sample generated after the DEN
pulse occurrence (see Figure 10. Level-sensitive latched mode, DEN active low, DEN_DRDY on INT1).

**Edge-sensitive and level-sensitive data enable (DEN)**

**4.8.4** **Level-sensitive FIFO enabled**

Level-sensitive FIFO enable mode can be enabled by setting the TRIG_EN and LVL1_EN bits in CTRL6_C to 1,
and the LVL2_EN bit in CTRL6_C to 0.

Once the level-sensitive FIFO enable mode is enabled, data is stored in the FIFO only when the DEN pin is equal
to the active state.

In this mode, the LSB bit of the selected data (in output registers and FIFO) is replaced by 0 for odd DEN events
and by 1 for even DEN events. This feature allows distinguishing the data stored in FIFO during the current DEN
active window from the data stored in FIFO during the next DEN active window.

The selected data can be the X, Y, Z axes of the accelerometer or gyroscope sensor. Data can be selected
through the DEN_X, DEN_Y, DEN_Z, DEN_XL_G bits in CTRL9_XL.

An example of level-sensitive FIFO enable mode is shown in Figure 11. Level-sensitive FIFO enable mode, DEN
active low, the red circles show the samples stored in the FIFO with LSB bit 0, while the blue circles show the
samples with LSB bit 1.

**Figure 11. Level-sensitive FIFO enable mode, DEN active low**

**4.8.5** **LSB selection for DEN stamping**

When level-sensitive modes (trigger or latched) are used, it is possible to select which LSB have to contain
information related to DEN pin behavior. This information can be stamped on the accelerometer or gyroscope
axes in accordance with bits DEN_X, DEN_Y, DEN_Z and DEN_XL_G of the CTRL9_XL register. Setting to 1 the
DEN_X, DEN_Y, DEN_Z bits, DEN information is stamped in the LSB of the corresponding axes of the sensor
selected with the DEN_XL_G bit. By setting DEN_XL_G to 0, the DEN information is stamped in the selected
gyroscope axes, while by setting DEN_XL_G to 1, the DEN information is stamped in the selected accelerometer

axes.

By default, the bits are configured to have information on all the gyroscope axes.

**Interrupt generation**
## **5 Interrupt generation**

In the LSM6DSL device the interrupt generation is based on accelerometer data only, so, for interrupt-generation
purposes, the accelerometer sensor has to be set in an active operating mode (not in Power-Down); the
gyroscope sensor can be configured in Power-Down mode since it’s not involved in interrupt generation.

The interrupt generator can be configured to detect:

         - Free-fall;

         - Wake-up;

         - 6D/4D orientation detection;

         - Single-tap and double-tap sensing;

         - Activity/Inactivity recognition.

In addition, the LSM6DSL can efficiently run the sensor-related features specified in Android, saving power and
enabling faster reaction time. The following functions are implemented in hardware using only the accelerometer:

         - Significant motion;

         - Relative tilt;

         - Absolute wrist tilt;

         - Pedometer functions;

         - Timestamp.

All these interrupt signals, together with the FIFO interrupt signals, can be independently driven to the INT1 and
INT2 interrupt pins or checked by reading the dedicated source register bits.

The H_LACTIVE bit of the CTRL3_C register must be used to select the polarity of the interrupt pins. If this bit is
set to 0 (default value), the interrupt pins are active high and they change from low to high level when the related
interrupt condition is verified. Otherwise, if the H_LACTIVE bit is set to 1 (active low), the interrupt pins are
normally at high level and they change from high to low when interrupt condition is reached.

The PP_OD bit of CTR3_C allows changing the behavior of the interrupt pins from push-pull to open drain. If the
PP_OD bit is set to 0, the interrupt pins are in push-pull configuration (low-impedance output for both high and low
level). When the PP_OD bit is set to 1, only the interrupt active state is a low-impedance output.

The LIR bit of TAP_CFG allows applying the latched mode to the interrupt signals. When the LIR bit is set to 1,
once the interrupt pin is asserted, it must be reset by reading the related interrupt source register. If the LIR bit is
set to 0, the interrupt signal is automatically reset when the interrupt condition is no longer verified or after a
certain amount of time.

**Interrupt pin configuration**

**5.1** **Interrupt pin configuration**

The device is provided with two pins that can be activated to generate either data-ready or interrupt signals. The
functionality of these pins is selected through the MD1_CFG and INT1_CTRL registers for the INT1 pin, and
through the MD2_CFG and INT2_CTRL registers for the INT2 pin.

A brief description of these interrupt control registers is given in the following summary; the default value of their
bits is equal to 0, which corresponds to ‘disable’. In order to enable the routing of a specific interrupt signal on the
pin, the related bit has to be set to 1.

If multiple interrupt signals are routed on the same pin (INTx), the logic level of this pin is the “OR” combination of
the selected interrupt signals. In order to know which event has generated the interrupt condition, the related
source registers have to be read: WAKE_UP_SRC, D6D_SRC, TAP_SRC, FUNC_SRC1 and FUNC_SRC2.

The INT2_on_INT1 pin of CTRL4_C register allows driving all the enabled interrupt signals in logic “OR” on the
INT1 pin (by setting this bit to 1). When this bit is set to 0, the interrupt signals are divided between the INT1 and
INT2 pins.

The basic interrupts (6D/4D, free-fall, wake-up, tap, inactivity) have to be enabled by setting the
INTERRUPTS_ENABLE bit in the TAP_CFG register.

**Free-fall interrupt**

**5.2** **Free-fall interrupt**

Free-fall detection refers to a specific register configuration that allows recognizing when the device is in free-fall:
the acceleration measured along all the axes goes to zero. In a real case a “free-fall zone” is defined around the
zero- *g* level where all the accelerations are small enough to generate the interrupt. Configurable threshold and
duration parameters are associated to free-fall event detection: the threshold parameter defines the free-fall zone
amplitude; the duration parameter defines the minimum duration of the free-fall interrupt event to be recognized
(Figure 12. Free-fall interrupt).

The free-fall interrupt signal can be enabled by setting the INTERRUPTS_ENABLE bit in the TAP_CFG register to
1 and can be driven to the two interrupt pins by setting the INT1_FF bit of the MD1_CFG register to 1 or the
INT2_FF bit of the MD2_CFG register to 1; it can also be checked by reading the FF_IA bit of the
WAKE_UP_SRC register.

If latched mode is disabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 0), the interrupt signal is automatically reset when the
free-fall condition is no longer verified. If latched mode is enabled and the free-fall interrupt signal is driven to the
interrupt pins, once a free-fall event has occurred and the interrupt pin is asserted, it must be reset by reading the
WAKE_UP_SRC register. If latched mode is enabled but the interrupt signal is not driven to the interrupt pins, the
latch feature does not take effect.

The FREE_FALL register used to configure the threshold parameter; the unsigned threshold value is related to
the value of the FF_THS[2:0] field value as indicated in Table 25. Free-fall threshold LSB value. The values given
in this table are valid for each accelerometer full-scale value.

**Wake-up interrupt**

Duration time is measured in N/ODR_XL, where N is the content of the FF_DUR[5:0] field of the FREE_FALL /
WAKE_UP_DUR registers and ODR_XL is the accelerometer data rate.

A basic SW routine for free-fall event recognition is given below.

// Turn on the accelerometer


1. Write 60h to CTRL1_XL


// ODR_XL = 416 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*


2. Write 81h to TAP_CFG // Enable interrupts and latch interrupt

3. Write 00h to WAKE_UP_DUR // Set event duration (FF_DUR5 bit)


4. Write 33h to FREE_FALL


// Set FF threshold (FF_THS[2:0] = 011b)

// Set six samples event duration (FF_DUR[5:0] = 000110b)


5. Write 10h to MD1_CFG // FF interrupt driven to INT1 pin

The sample code exploits a threshold set to 312 m *g* for free-fall recognition and the event is notified by hardware
through the INT1 pin. The FF_DUR[5:0] field of the FREE_FALL / WAKE_UP_DUR registers is configured like this
to ignore events that are shorter than 6/ODR_XL = 6/412 Hz ~= 15 msec in order to avoid false detections.

**5.3** **Wake-up interrupt**

In the LSM6DSL device the wake-up feature can be implemented using either the slope filter (see Section
3.7.1 Accelerometer slope filter for more details) or the high-pass digital filter, as illustrated in Figure
2. Accelerometer filtering chain. The filter to be applied can be selected using the SLOPE_FDS bit of the
TAP_CFG register: if this bit is set to 0 (default value), the slope filter is used; if it’s set to 1, the HPF digital filter is
used.

The wake-up interrupt signal is generated if a certain number of consecutive filtered data exceed the configured
threshold (Figure 13. Wake-up interrupt (using the slope filter)).

The unsigned threshold value is defined using the WK_THS[5:0] bits of the WAKE_UP_THS register; the value of
1 LSB of these 6 bits depends on the selected accelerometer full scale: 1 LSB = (FS_XL)/(2 [6] ). The threshold is
applied to both positive and negative data: for wake-up interrupt generation, the absolute value of the filtered data
must be bigger than the threshold.

The duration parameter defines the minimum duration of the wake-up event to be recognized; its value is set
using the WAKE_DUR[1:0] bits of the WAKE_UP_DUR register: 1 LSB corresponds to 1/ODR_XL time, where
ODR_XL is the accelerometer output data rate. It is important to appropriately define the duration parameter to
avoid unwanted wake-up interrupts due to spurious spikes of the input signal.

This interrupt signal can be enabled by setting the INTERRUPTS_ENABLE bit in TAP_CFG register to 1 and can
be driven to the two interrupt pins setting to 1 the INT1_WU bit of the MD1_CFG register or the INT2_WU bit of
the MD2_CFG register; it can also be checked by reading the WU_IA bit of the WAKE_UP_SRC register. The
X_WU, Y_WU, Z_WU bits of the WAKE_UP_SRC register indicate which axis has triggered the wake-up event.

If latch mode is disabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 0), the interrupt signal is automatically reset when the
filtered data falls below the threshold. If latch mode is enabled and the wake-up interrupt signal is driven to the
interrupt pins, once a wake-up event has occurred and the interrupt pin is asserted, it must be reset by reading
the WAKE_UP_SRC register. If the latch mode is enabled but the interrupt signal is not driven to the interrupt
pins, the latch feature does not take effect.

A basic SW routine for wake-up event recognition using the high-pass digital filter is given below.

// Turn on the accelerometer


1. Write 60h to CTRL1_XL

2. Write 90h to TAP_CFG


// ODR_XL = 416 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*

// Enable interrupts and apply high-pass digital filter; latched

// mode disabled


3. Write 00h to WAKE_UP_DUR // No duration

4. Write 02h to WAKE_UP_THS // Set wake-up threshold

5. Write 20h to MD1_CFG // Wake-up interrupt driven to INT1 pin

Since the duration time is set to zero, the wake-up interrupt signal is generated for each X,Y,Z filtered data
exceeding the configured threshold. The WK_THS field of the WAKE_UP_THS register is set to 000010b,
therefore the wake-up threshold is 62.5 m *g* (= 2 * FS_XL / 2 [6] ).

Since the wake-up functionality is implemented using the slope/high-pass digital filter, it is necessary to consider
the settling time of the filter just after this functionality is enabled. For example, when using the slope filter (but a
similar consideration can be done for the high-pass digital filter usage) the wake-up functionality is based on the

**AN5040**

**Wake-up interrupt**

comparison of the threshold value with half of the difference of the acceleration of the current (x,y,z) sample and
the previous one (refer to Section 3.7.1 Accelerometer slope filter).

At the very first sample, the slope filter output is calculated as half of the difference of the current sample [e.g.
(x,y,z) = (0,0,1g)] with the previous one which is (x,y,z)=(0,0,0) since it doesn't exist. For this reason, on the z-axis
the first output value of the slope filter is (1g - 0)/2=500 m *g* and it could be higher than the threshold value in
which case a spurious interrupt event is generated. The interrupt signal is kept high for 1 ODR then it goes low.

In order to avoid this spurious interrupt generation, multiple solutions are possible. Hereafter are three alternative
solutions (for the slope filter case):

**a.** Ignore the first generated wake-up signal;

**b.** Add a wait time higher than 1 ODR before driving the interrupt signal to the INT1/2 pin;

**c.** Initially set a higher ODR (833 Hz) so the first 2 samples are generated in a shorter period of time, reducing the
slope filter latency time, then set the desired ODR (e.g. 12.5 Hz) and drive the interrupt signal on the pin, as
indicated in the procedure below:

1. Write 00h to WAKE_UP_DUR // No duration

2. Write 02h to WAKE_UP_THS // Set wake-up threshold

3. Write 80h to TAP_CFG // Enable interrupts and apply slope filter; latch mode disabled

// Turn on the accelerometer


4. Write 70h to CTRL1_XL


// ODR_XL = 833 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*


5. Wait 4 ms // Insert (reduced) wait time

6. Write 10h to CTRL1_XL // ODR_XL = 12.5 Hz

7. Write 20h to MD1_CFG // Wake-up interrupt driven to INT1 pin

**6D/4D orientation detection**

**5.4** **6D/4D orientation detection**

The LSM6DSL device provides the capability to detect the orientation of the device in space, enabling easy
implementation of energy-saving procedures and automatic image rotation for mobile devices.

**5.4.1** **6D orientation detection**

Six orientations of the device in space can be detected; the interrupt signal is asserted when the device switches
from one orientation to another. The interrupt is not re-asserted as long as the position is maintained.

6D interrupt is generated when, for two consecutive samples, only one axis exceeds a selected threshold and the
acceleration values measured from the other two axes are lower than the threshold: the ZH, ZL, YH, YL, XH, XL
bits of the D6D_SRC register indicate which axis has triggered the 6D event.

In more detail:

**Table 26. D6D_SRC register**

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DEN_<br>DRDY|D6D_IA|ZH|ZL|YH|YL|XH|XL|



         - D6D_IA is set high when the device switches from one orientation to another.

         - ZH (YH, XH) is set high when the face perpendicular to the Z (Y, X) axis is almost flat and the acceleration
measured on the Z (Y, X) axis is positive and in the absolute value bigger than the threshold.

         - ZL (YL, XL) is set high when the face perpendicular to the Z (Y, X) axis is almost flat and the acceleration
measured on the Z (Y, X) axis is negative and in the absolute value bigger than the threshold.

The SIXD_THS[1:0] bits of the TAP_THS_6D register are used to select the threshold value used to detect the
change in device orientation. The threshold values given in Table 27. Threshold for 4D/6D function are valid for
each accelerometer full-scale value.

**Table 27. Threshold for 4D/6D function**

|SIXD_THS[1:0]|Threshold value [degrees]|
|---|---|
|00|80|
|01|70|
|10|60|
|11|50|



The low-pass filter LPF2 can also be used in 6D functionality by setting the LOW_PASS_ON_6D bit of the
CTRL8_XL register to 1.

This interrupt signal can be enabled by setting the INTERRUPTS_ENABLE bit in the TAP_CFG register to 1 and
can be driven to the two interrupt pins by setting to 1 the INT1_6D bit of the MD1_CFG register or the INT2_6D bit
of the MD2_CFG register; it can also be checked by reading the D6D_IA bit of the D6D_SRC register.

If latched mode is disabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 0), the interrupt signal is active only for 1/ODR_XL[s]
then it is automatically disserted (ODR_XL is the accelerometer output data rate). If latched mode is enabled and
the 6D interrupt signal is driven to the interrupt pins, once an orientation change has occurred and the interrupt
pin is asserted, a reading of the D6D_SRC register clears the request and the device is ready to recognize a
different orientation. If latched mode is enabled but the interrupt signal is not driven to the interrupt pins, the latch
feature does not take effect.

**6D/4D orientation detection**

Referring to the six possible cases illustrated in Figure 14. 6D recognized orientations, the content of the
D6D_SRC register for each position is shown in Table 28. D6D_SRC register in 6D positions.

**Figure 14. 6D recognized orientations**

A basic SW routine for 6D orientation detection is as follows.

// Turn on the accelerometer

1. Write 60h to CTRL1_XL

// ODR_XL = 416 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*

2. Write 80h to TAP_CFG // Enable interrupts; latched mode disabled

3. Write 40h to TAP_THS_6D // Set 6D threshold (SIXD_THS[1:0] = 10b = 60 degrees)

4. Write 01h to CTRL8_XL // Enable LPF2 filter to 6D functionality

5. Write 04h to MD1_CFG // 6D interrupt driven to INT1 pin

**Single-tap and double-tap recognition**

**5.4.2** **4D orientation detection**

The 4D direction function is a subset of the 6D function especially defined to be implemented in mobile devices
for portrait and landscape computation. It can be enabled by setting the D4D_EN bit of the TAP_THS_6D register
to 1. In this configuration, the Z-axis position detection is disabled, therefore reducing position recognition to
cases (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Table 28. D6D_SRC register in 6D positions.

**5.5** **Single-tap and double-tap recognition**

The single-tap and double-tap recognition functions featured in the LSM6DSL help to create a man-machine
interface with little software loading. The device can be configured to output an interrupt signal on a dedicated pin
when tapped in any direction.

If the sensor is exposed to a single input stimulus, it generates an interrupt request on the inertial interrupt pin
INT1 and/or INT2. A more advanced feature allows the generation of an interrupt request when a double input
stimulus with programmable time between the two events is recognized, enabling a mouse button-like function.

In the LSM6DSL device the single-tap and double-tap recognition functions use the slope between two
consecutive acceleration samples to detect the tap events; the slope data is calculated using the following
formula:

slope(t n ) = [ acc(t n ) - acc(t n-1 ) ] / 2

This function can be fully programmed by the user in terms of expected amplitude and timing of the slope data by
means of a dedicated set of registers.

Single and double-tap recognition work independently of the selected output data rate. Recommended
accelerometer ODRs for these functions are 416 Hz and 833 Hz.

In order to enable the single-tap and double-tap recognition functions it is necessary to set the
INTERRUPTS_ENABLE bit in TAP_CFG register to 1.

**Single-tap and double-tap recognition**

**5.5.1** **Single tap**

If the device is configured for single-tap event detection, an interrupt is generated when the slope data of the
selected channel exceeds the programmed threshold, and returns below it within the Shock time window.

In the single-tap case, if the LIR bit of the TAP_CFG register is set to 0, the interrupt is kept active for the duration
of the Quiet window.

In order to enable the latch feature on the single-tap interrupt signal, both the LIR bit and the INT1_DOUBLE_TAP
(or INT2_DOUBLE_TAP) bit of MD1_CFG (MD2_CFG) have to be set to 1: the interrupt is kept active until the
TAP_SRC register is read.

The SINGLE_DOUBLE_TAP bit of WAKE_UP_THS has to be set to 0 in order to enable single-tap recognition
only.

In case (a) of Figure 15. Single-tap event recognition the single-tap event has been recognized, while in case (b)
the tap has not been recognized because the slope data falls below the threshold after the Shock time window
has expired.

**Single-tap and double-tap recognition**

**5.5.2** **Double tap**

If the device is configured for double-tap event detection, an interrupt is generated when, after a first tap, a
second tap is recognized. The recognition of the second tap occurs only if the event satisfies the rules defined by
the Shock, the Latency and the Duration time windows.

In particular, after the first tap has been recognized, the second tap detection procedure is delayed for an interval
defined by the Quiet time. This means that after the first tap has been recognized, the second tap detection
procedure starts only if the slope data exceeds the threshold after the Quiet window but before the Duration
window has expired. In case (a) of Figure 16. Double-tap event recognition (LIR bit = 0), a double-tap event has
been correctly recognized, while in case (b) the interrupt has not been generated because the slope data exceeds
the threshold after the window interval has expired.

Once the second tap detection procedure is initiated, the second tap is recognized with the same rule as the first:
the slope data must return below the threshold before the Shock window has expired.

It is important to appropriately define the Quiet window to avoid unwanted taps due to spurious bouncing of the
input signal.

In the double-tap case, if the LIR bit of the TAP_CFG register is set to 0, the interrupt is kept active for the
duration of the Quiet window. If the LIR bit is set to 1, the interrupt is kept active until the TAP_SRC register is
read.

**Single-tap and double-tap recognition**

**5.5.3** **Single-tap and double-tap recognition configuration**

The LSM6DSL device can be configured to output an interrupt signal when tapped (once or twice) in any
direction: the TAP_X_EN, TAP_Y_EN and TAP_Z_EN bits of the TAP_CFG register must be set to 1 to enable the
tap recognition on the X, Y, Z directions, respectively. In addition, the INTERRUPTS_ENABLE bit of the TAP_CFG
register has to be set to 1.

Configurable parameters for tap recognition functionality are the tap threshold and the Shock, Quiet and Duration
time windows.

The TAP_THS[4:0] bits of the TAP_THS_6D register are used to select the unsigned threshold value used to
detect the tap event. The value of 1 LSB of these 5 bits depends on the selected accelerometer full scale: 1 LSB
= (FS_XL)/(2 [5] ). The unsigned threshold is applied to both positive and negative slope data.

*Note: Tap threshold (in mg) set through the TAP_THS[4:0] bits of the TAP_THS_6D register must be higher than*
*the wake-up threshold (in mg) set through the WK_THS[5:0] bits of the WAKE_UP_THS register.*

The Shock time window defines the maximum duration of the overcoming threshold event: the acceleration must
return below the threshold before the Shock window has expired, otherwise the tap event is not detected. The
SHOCK[1:0] bits of the INT_DUR2 register are used to set the Shock time window value: the default value of
these bits is 00b and corresponds to 4/ODR_XL time, where ODR_XL is the accelerometer output data rate. If the
SHOCK[1:0] bits are set to a different value, 1 LSB corresponds to 8/ODR_XL time.

In the double-tap case, the Quiet time window defines the time after the first tap recognition in which there must
not be any overcoming threshold event. When latched mode is disabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 0), the
Quiet time also defines the length of the interrupt pulse (in both single and double-tap case). The QUIET[1:0] bits
of the INT_DUR2 register are used to set the Quiet time window value: the default value of these bits is 00b and
corresponds to 2/ODR_XL time, where ODR_XL is the accelerometer output data rate. If the QUIET[1:0] bits are
set to a different value, 1 LSB corresponds to 4/ODR_XL time.

In the double-tap case, the Duration time window defines the maximum time between two consecutive detected
taps. The Duration time period starts just after the completion of the Quiet time of the first tap. The DUR[3:0] bits
of the INT_DUR2 register are used to set the Duration time window value: the default value of these bits is 0000b
and corresponds to 16/ODR_XL time, where ODR_XL is the accelerometer output data rate. If the DUR[3:0] bits
are set to a different value, 1 LSB corresponds to 32/ODR_XL time.

Figure 17. Single and double-tap recognition (LIR bit = 0) illustrates a single-tap event (a) and a double-tap event
(b). These interrupt signals can be driven to the two interrupt pins by setting to 1 the INT1_SINGLE_TAP bit of the
MD1_CFG register or the INT2_SINGLE_TAP bit of the MD2_CFG register for the single-tap case, and setting to
1 the INT1_DOUBLE_TAP bit of the MD1_CFG register or the INT2_DOUBLE_TAP bit of the MD2_CFG register
for the double-tap case.

No single/double-tap interrupt is generated if the accelerometer is in Inactivity status (see Section 5.6 Activity/
Inactivity recognition for more details).

Tap interrupt signals can also be checked by reading the TAP_SRC (1Ch) register, described in Table
29. TAP_SRC register.

**Table 29. TAP_SRC register**






|b7|b6|b5|b4|b3|b2|b1|b0|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|TAP_IA|SINGLE<br>_TAP|DOUBLE<br>_TAP|TAP_<br>SIGN|X_TAP|Y_TAP|Z_TAP|



         - TAP_IA is set high when a single-tap or double-tap event has been detected.

         - SINGLE_TAP is set high when a single tap has been detected.

         - DOUBLE_TAP is set high when a double tap has been detected.

         - TAP_SIGN indicates the acceleration sign when the tap event is detected. It is set low in case of positive
sign and it is set high in case of negative sign.

         - X_TAP (Y_TAP, Z_TAP) is set high when the tap event has been detected on the X (Y, Z) axis.

Single and double-tap recognition works independently. Setting the SINGLE_DOUBLE_TAP bit of the
WAKE_UP_THS register to 0, only the single-tap recognition is enabled: double-tap recognition is disabled and
cannot be detected. When the SINGLE_DOUBLE_TAP is set to 1, both single and double-tap recognition are
enabled.

If latched mode is enabled and the interrupt signal is driven to the interrupt pins, the value assigned to
SINGLE_DOUBLE_TAP also affects the behavior of the interrupt signal: when it is set to 0, the latched mode is
applied to the single-tap interrupt signal; when it is set to 1, the latched mode is applied to the double-tap interrupt
signal only. The latched interrupt signal is kept active until the TAP_SRC register is read. If latched mode is
enabled but the interrupt signal is not driven to the interrupt pins, the latch feature does not take effect.

**Single-tap and double-tap recognition**


**5.5.4** **Single-tap example**

A basic SW routine for single-tap detection is given below.

// Turn on the accelerometer


1. Write 60h to CTRL1_XL


// ODR_XL = 416 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*


2. Write 8Eh to TAP_CFG // Enable interrupts and tap detection on X, Y, Z axis

3. Write 89h to TAP_THS_6D // Set tap threshold

4. Write 06h to INT_DUR2 // Set Quiet and Shock time windows

5. Write 00h to WAKE_UP_THS // Only single-tap enabled (SINGLE_DOUBLE_TAP = 0)

6. Write 40h to MD1_CFG // Single-tap interrupt driven to INT1 pin

In this example the TAP_THS field of the TAP_THS_6D register is set to 01001b, therefore the tap threshold is
562.5 m *g* (= 9 * FS_XL / 2 [5] ).

The SHOCK field of the INT_DUR2 register is set to 10b: an interrupt is generated when the slope data exceeds
the programmed threshold, and returns below it within 38.5 ms (= 2 * 8 / ODR_XL) corresponding to the Shock
time window.

The QUIET field of the INT_DUR2 register is set to 01b: since latched mode is disabled, the interrupt is kept high
for the duration of the Quiet window, therefore 9.6 ms (= 1 * 4 / ODR_XL).

**5.5.5** **Double-tap example**

A basic SW routine for double-tap detection is given below.

// Turn on the accelerometer


1. Write 60h to CTRL1_XL


// ODR_XL = 416 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*


2. Write 8Eh to TAP_CFG // Enable interrupts and tap detection on X, Y, Z-axis

3. Write 8Ch to TAP_THS_6D // Set tap threshold

4. Write 7Fh to INT_DUR2 // Set Duration, Quiet and Shock time windows

5. Write 80h to WAKE_UP_THS // Single & double-tap enabled (SINGLE_DOUBLE_TAP = 1)

6. Write 08h to MD1_CFG // Double-tap interrupt driven to INT1 pin

In this example the TAP_THS field of the TAP_THS_6D register is set to 01100b, therefore the tap threshold is
750 m *g* (= 12 * FS_XL / 2 [5] ).

For interrupt generation, during the first and the second tap the slope data must return below the threshold before
the Shock window has expired. The SHOCK field of the INT_DUR2 register is set to 11b, therefore the Shock time
is 57.7 ms (= 3 * 8 / ODR_XL).

For interrupt generation, after the first tap recognition there must not be any slope data overthreshold during the
Quiet time window. Furthermore, since latched mode is disabled, the interrupt is kept high for the duration of the
Quiet window. The QUIET field of the INT_DUR2 register is set to 11b, therefore the Quiet time is 28.8 ms
(= 3 * 4 / ODR_XL).

For the maximum time between two consecutive detected taps, the DUR field of the INT_DUR2 register is set to
0111b, therefore the Duration time is 538.5 ms (= 7 * 32 / ODR_XL).

**AN5040**

**Activity/Inactivity recognition**

**5.6** **Activity/Inactivity recognition**

The Activity/Inactivity recognition function allows reducing system power consumption and developing new smart
applications.

When the Activity/Inactivity recognition function is activated, the LSM6DSL device is able to automatically
decrease the accelerometer sampling rate to 12.5 Hz, increasing the accelerometer ODR and bandwidth as soon
as the wake-up interrupt event has been detected. In the LSM6DSL this feature can be extended to gyroscope,
with three possible options:

         - Gyroscope configurations do not change;

         - Gyroscope enters in Sleep mode;

         - Gyroscope enters in Power-Down mode.

With this feature the system may be efficiently switched from low-power consumption to full performance and
vice-versa depending on user-selectable acceleration events, thus ensuring power saving and flexibility.

The maximum allowed accelerometer ODR (configurable through the ODR_XL [3:0] bits of the CTRL1_XL
register) for using the Activity/Inactivity feature is 3.3 kHz.

The Activity/Inactivity recognition function is enabled by setting the INTERRUPTS_ENABLE bit to 1 and
configuring the INACT_EN bits of the TAP_CFG register. Possible configurations of the inactivity event are
summarized in Table 30. Inactivity event configuration.

**Table 30. Inactivity event configuration**

|INACT_EN[1:0]|Accelerometer|Gyroscope|
|---|---|---|
|00|Inactivity event disabled|Inactivity event disabled|
|01|XL ODR = 12.5 Hz (Low-Power mode)|Gyro configuration unchanged|
|10|XL ODR = 12.5 Hz (Low-Power mode)|Gyro in Sleep mode|
|11|XL ODR = 12.5 Hz (Low-Power mode)|Gyro in Power-Down mode|



In the LSM6DSL device the Activity/Inactivity recognition function can be implemented using either the slope filter
(see Section 3.7.1 Accelerometer slope filter for more details) or the high-pass digital filter, as illustrated in Figure
2. Accelerometer filtering chain. The filter to be applied can be selected using the SLOPE_FDS bit of the
TAP_CFG register: if this bit is set to 0 (default value), the slope filter is used; if it is set to 1, the high-pass digital
filter is used.

This function can be fully programmed by the user in terms of expected amplitude and timing of the filtered data
by means of a dedicated set of registers (Figure 18. Activity/Inactivity recognition (using the slope filter)).

The unsigned threshold value is defined using the WK_THS[5:0] bits of the WAKE_UP_THS register; the value of
1 LSB of these 6 bits depends on the selected accelerometer full scale: 1 LSB = (FS_XL)/(2 [6] ). The threshold is
applied to both positive and negative filtered data.

When a certain number of consecutive X,Y,Z filtered data is smaller than the configured threshold, the ODR_XL

[3:0] bits of the CTRL1_XL register are bypassed (Inactivity) and the accelerometer is internally set to 12.5 Hz
although the content of CTRL1_XL is left untouched. The gyroscope behavior varies according to the
configuration of the INACT_EN bits of the TAP_CFG register. The duration of the Inactivity status to be
recognized is defined by the SLEEP_DUR[3:0] bits of the WAKE_UP_DUR register: 1 LSB corresponds to 512/
ODR_XL time, where ODR_XL is the accelerometer output data rate.

When the Inactivity status is detected, the interrupt is set high for 1/ODR_XL[s] period then it is automatically
deasserted.

When a single sample of X,Y,Z filtered data on one axis becomes bigger than the threshold, the CTRL1_XL
register settings are immediately restored (Activity) and the gyroscope is restored to the previous state.

When the Activity status is detected, the interrupt is set high for 1/ODR_XL[s] period then it is automatically
deasserted.

Once the Activity/Inactivity detection function is enabled, the status can be driven to the two interrupt pins by
setting to 1 the INT1_INACT_STATE bit of the MD1_CFG register or the INT2_INACT_STATE bit of the
MD2_CFG register; it can also be checked by reading the SLEEP_STATE_IA bit of the WAKE_UP_SRC register.

A basic SW routine for Activity/Inactivity detection is as follows:

// Turn on the accelerometer


1. Write 50h to CTRL1_XL

2. Write 40h to CTRL2_G


// ODR_XL = 208 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*

// Turn on the gyroscope

// ODR_G = 104 Hz, FS_G = ±250 dps


3. Write 02h to WAKE_UP_DUR // Set duration for Inactivity detection

4. Write 02h to WAKE_UP_THS // Set Activity/Inactivity threshold

// Enable interrupts


5. Write E0h to TAP_CFG


// Inactivity configuration: acc to 12.5 LP, gyro to Power-Down

// Enable slope filter


6. Write 80h to MD1_CFG // Activity/Inactivity interrupt driven to INT1 pin

In this example the WK_THS field of the WAKE_UP_THS register is set to 000010b, therefore the Activity/
Inactivity threshold is 62.5 m *g* (= 2 * FS_XL / 2 [6] ).

Before Inactivity detection, the X,Y,Z slope data must be smaller than the configured threshold for a period of time
defined by the SLEEP_DUR field of the WAKE_UP_DUR register: this field is set to 0010b, corresponding to
4.92 s (= 2 * 512 / ODR_XL). After this period of time has elapsed, the accelerometer ODR is internally set to
12.5 Hz and the gyroscope is internally set to Power-Down mode.

The Activity status is detected, the CTRL1_XL register settings immediately restored and the gyroscope is turned
on if the slope data of (at least) one axis are bigger than the threshold.

**Boot status**

**5.7** **Boot status**

After the device is powered up, the LSM6DSL performs a 15 ms boot procedure to load the trimming parameters.
After the boot is completed, both the accelerometer and the gyroscope are automatically configured in PowerDown mode. During the boot time the registers are not accessible.

After power up, the trimming parameters can be re-loaded by setting the BOOT bit of the CTRL3_C register to 1.

No toggle of the device power lines is required and the content of the device control registers is not modified, so
the device operating mode doesn’t change after boot. If the reset to the default value of the control registers is
required, it can be performed by setting the SW_RESET bit of the CTRL3_C register to 1. The SW_RESET
procedure can take 50 µs; the status of reset is signaled by the status of the SW_RESET bit of the CTRL3_C
register: once the reset is completed, this bit is automatically set low.

The boot status signal is driven to the INT1 interrupt pin by setting the INT1_BOOT bit of the INT1_CTRL register
to 1: this signal is set high while the boot is running and it is set low again at the end of the boot procedure.

The reboot flow is as follows:

1. Set the gyroscope in Power-Down mode;

2. Set the accelerometer in High-Performance mode;

3. Set to 1 the BOOT bit of the CTRL3_C register;

4. Wait 15 ms.

Reset flow is as follows:

1. Set the gyroscope in Power-Down mode;

2. Set the accelerometer in High-Performance mode;

3. Set to 1 the SW_RESET bit of the CTRL3_C register;

4. Wait 50 µs (or wait until the SW_RESET bit of the CTRL3_C register returns to 0).

In order to avoid conflicts, the reboot and the sw reset must not be executed at the same time (do not set to 1 at
the same time both the BOOT bit and SW_RESET bit of CTRL3_C register). The above flows must be performed
serially.

**Embedded functions**
## **6 Embedded functions**

The LSM6DSL device implements in hardware many embedded functions; specific IP blocks with negligible
power consumption and high-level performance implement the following functions using only the accelerometer:

         - Pedometer functions (step detector and step counter);

         - Significant motion;

         - Relative tilt;

         - Absolute wrist tilt;

         - Timestamp.

All these functions work at 26 Hz, so the accelerometer ODR must be set at a value of 26 Hz or higher.

**6.1** **Pedometer functions: step detector and step counter**

A specific IP block of the LSM6DSL device is dedicated to pedometer functions: the step detector and the step
counter.

Pedometer functions work at 26 Hz, so the accelerometer ODR must be set at a value of 26 Hz or higher.

In order to enable the pedometer functions it is necessary to set to 1 both the FUNC_EN bit and the PEDO_EN bit
of the CTRL10_C register.

The step counter indicates the number of steps detected by the step detector algorithm after the pedometer
function has been enabled. The step count is given by the concatenation of the STEP_COUNTER_H and
STEP_COUNTER_L registers and it is represented as a 16-bit unsigned number.

The step count is not reset to zero when the accelerometer is configured in Power-Down or the pedometer is
disabled; it can be reset to zero by setting the PEDO_RST_STEP bit of the CTRL10_C register to 1. After the
counter resets, the PEDO_RST_STEP bit is not automatically set back to 0.

The step detector functionality generates an interrupt every time a step is recognized. In case of interspersed step
sessions, 7 consecutive steps (debounce steps) have to be detected before the first interrupt generation in order
to avoid false step detections (debounce functionality).

The number of debounce steps can be modified through the DEB_STEP field of the PEDO_DEB_REG register:
basically, it corresponds to the minimum number of steps to be detected before the first step counter increment. 1
LSB of this field corresponds to 1 step, the default value is 6 steps.

The debounce functionality restarts after around 1 second of device inactivity. This period of time (debouncing
time) can be modified through the DEB_TIME field of the PEDO_DEB_REG register. 1LSB corresponds to 80 ms,
the default value is 13 (13 * 80 ms = 1040 ms). This value must be greater than 0.

The example in Figure 19. Pedometer debounce explains how the step counter behavior changes by changing
the debounce time. In this example, the pedometer algorithm detects 7 steps close to each other and then two
more isolated steps after a certain period of time; assuming that the value of the DEB_STEP field of the
PEDO_DEB_REG register is set to 6 LSB (= 6 debounce steps, default value) and the initial step counter value in
the STEP_COUNTER_H/L registers is zero (no steps previously detected):

**a.** in case (a), the step count starts increasing after the seventh step and after the first eight detected steps, the
value of STEP_COUNTER_H/L registers will be 8. Since the debounce time set in the DEB_TIME field of the
PEDO_DEB_REG register is greater than the period of time between the step #8 and the step #9, also the steps
#9 and #10 will cause the step counter to increase: the final step count value in STEP_COUNTER_H/L registers
will be 10.

**b.** also in case (b) the step count starts increasing after the seventh step and after the first eight detected steps,
the value of STEP_COUNTER_H/L registers will be 8, but since the debounce time set in the DEB_TIME field of
the PEDO_DEB_REG register is lower than the period of time between the step #8 and the step #9, the steps #9
and #10 will not cause the step counter to increase: the final step count value in STEP_COUNTER_H/L registers
will be 8. Furthermore, if between the step #10 and the following step elapses a period of time greater than the
debounce time, the detected steps #9 and #10 will be definitively discarded and no longer considered.

By default, the step counter works at ±2 *g* full scale, independently of the configured device full scale, but it can
be configured to work at ±4 *g* full scale which can help to avoid acceleration saturation (e.g. in fast walk). In order
to set the ±4 *g* full scale for the step counter, the PEDO_FS bit of the CONFIG_PEDO_THS_MIN register has to
be set to 1 and the accelerometer full scale configured in CTRL1_XL register must be ≥ ±4 *g* .

It is also possible to set the “Minimum Threshold”, that is the value at which the threshold for step recognition
asymptotically tends if no steps are detected and below which it cannot descend (see Figure 20. Pedometer
minimum threshold). This configuration is available in the ths_min field of the CONFIG_PEDO_THS_MIN register.
The value of 1 LSB of these 5 bits depends on the selected step counter full scale: 1 LSB = 32 m *g* if the
PEDO_FS bit is 0; 1 LSB = 62.5 m *g* if the PEDO_FS bit is 1.

The step detector interrupt signal can be driven to the INT1 interrupt pin by setting the INT1_STEP_DETECTOR
bit of the INT1_CTRL register to 1; it can also be checked by reading the STEP_DETECTED bit of the
FUNC_SRC1 register.

**Significant motion**

Instead of generating an interrupt every time a step is recognized, it is possible to generate it if at least one step is
detected within a certain time period. This time period is defined by setting a value higher than 00h in the
STEP_COUNT_DELTA register. It is necessary to set the TIMER_EN bit of the CTRL10_C register to 1 (to enable
the timer) and the TIMER_HR bit of the WAKE_UP_DUR register to 0 when using this feature: in this case, 1 LSB
of the value of the STEP_COUNT_DELTA register corresponds to 1.6384 seconds. This interrupt signal can be
driven to the INT2 interrupt pin by setting to 1 the INT2_STEP_DELTA bit of the INT2_CTRL register; it can also
be checked by reading the STEP_COUNT_DELTA_IA bit of the FUNC_SRC1 register.

The step counter overflow signal can be driven to the INT2 interrupt pin by setting the INT2_STEP_COUNT_OV
bit of the INT2_CTRL register to 1: in this case, when the step count reaches the 2 [16] value, an interrupt signal is
generated on the INT2 pin and the step count is automatically reset to zero, no need to reset it by setting the
PEDO_RST_STEP bit to 1.

If latched mode is disabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 0), the interrupt signal generated by the pedometer
functions is pulsed: the duration of the pulse observed on the interrupt pins is about 150 µs; the duration of the
pulse observed on the bits STEP_COUNT_DELTA_IA, STEP_DETECTED and STEP_OVERFLOW of the
FUNC_SRC1 register is 1/26 Hz.

If latched mode is enabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 1) and the interrupt signal is driven to the interrupt pins,
once a step has occurred, a reading of the FUNC_SRC1 register clears the request on both the pins and the
STEP_COUNT_DELTA_IA, STEP_DETECTED and STEP_OVERFLOW bits of the FUNC_SRC1 register, and
the device is ready to recognize the next step. If latched mode is enabled but the interrupt signal is not driven to
the interrupt pins, the interrupt signal observed on the bits of the FUNC_SRC1 register is pulsed, with a fixed
duration of 1/26 Hz.

Step counter timestamp information is available in the STEP_TIMESTAMP_H and STEP_TIMESTAMP_L
registers: when a step is detected, the value of the TIMESTAMP_REG2 register is copied in
STEP_TIMESTAMP_H, and the value of the TIMESTAMP_REG1 register is copied in STEP_TIMESTAMP_L,
providing the timestamp information of this step. For more details about LSM6DSL timestamp counter and
TIMESTAMP_REG2/TIMESTAMP_REG1, see Section 6.5 Timestamp.

The step counter timestamp resolution depends on the value of the TIMER_HR bit of the WAKE_UP_DUR
register: when this bit is set to 0, 1 LSB of the time step count corresponds to 1638.4 ms; when this bit is set to 1,
1 LSB of the time step count corresponds to 6.4 ms.

Step counter data can be stored in FIFO as a fourth data set along with timestamp data (see Section 8.8 Step
counter and timestamp data in FIFO for more details).

A basic SW routine which shows how to enable the pedometer functions is as follows:

1. Write 80h to FUNC_CFG_ACCESS // Enable access to embedded functions registers (bank A)

2. Write 8Eh to CONFIG_PEDO_THS_MIN // PEDO_FS = ±4 *g* and configure pedometer minimum threshold value

3. Write 00h to FUNC_CFG_ACCESS // Disable access to embedded functions registers (bank A)

// Turn on the accelerometer


4. Write 28h to CTRL1_XL


// ODR_XL = 26 Hz, FS_XL = ±4 *g*


5. Write 14h to CTRL10_C // Enable embedded functions and pedometer algorithm

6. Write 80h to INT1_CTRL // Step detector interrupt driven to INT1 pin

The interrupt signal is generated when a step is recognized and the step count is available by reading the
STEP_COUNTER_H / STEP_COUNTER_L registers.

**6.2** **Significant motion**

The significant motion function generates an interrupt when a ‘significant motion’, that could be due to a change in
user location, is detected: in the LSM6DSL device this function has been implemented in hardware using only the
accelerometer.

The significant motion functionality can be used in location-based applications in order to receive a notification
indicating when the user is changing location.

~~**AN50**~~ **4** ~~**0**~~ - ~~**Rev**~~ **3** **p** **a** **g** **e** ~~**52/108**~~

**AN5040**

**Significant motion**

The significant motion function works at 26 Hz, so the accelerometer ODR must be set at a value of 26 Hz or
higher.

In order to enable significant motion detection it is necessary to set to 1 both the FUNC_EN bit and the
SIGN_MOTION_EN bit of the CTRL10_C register.

The significant motion interrupt signal is driven to the INT1 interrupt pin by setting the INT1_SIGN_MOT bit of the
INT1_CTRL register to 1; it can also be checked by reading the SIGN_MOTION_IA bit of the FUNC_SRC1
register.

If latched mode is disabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 0), the interrupt signal generated by the significant
motion function is pulsed: the duration of the pulse observed on the interrupt pins is about 150 µs; the duration of
the pulse observed on the SIGN_MOTION_IA bit of the FUNC_SRC1 register is 1/26 Hz.

If latched mode is enabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 1) and the interrupt signal is driven to the interrupt pins,
once a ‘significant motion’ is detected, a reading of the FUNC_SRC1 register clears the request on both the pins
and the SIGN_MOTION_IA bit of the FUNC_SRC1 register, and the device is ready to recognize the next event. If
latched mode is enabled but the interrupt signal is not driven to the interrupt pins, the interrupt signal observed on
the SIGN_MOTION_IA bit of the FUNC_SRC1 register is pulsed, with a fixed duration of 1/26 Hz.

The embedded function register (accessible by setting the FUNC_CFG_EN bit of FUNC_CFG_ACCESS to 1)
used to configure the significant motion threshold parameter is the SM_THS register. The SM_THS_[7:0] bits of
this register define the threshold value: it corresponds to the number of steps to be performed by the user upon a
change of location before the significant motion interrupt is generated. It is expressed as an 8-bit unsigned value:
the default value of this field is equal to 6 (= 00000110b).

When the debounce functionality of the pedometer is active (see Section 6.1 Pedometer functions: step detector
and step counter for details), the significant motion threshold is effective only if its value, corresponding to the
value of the SM_THS_[7:0] bits of the SM_THS register, is equal to or greater than the pedometer debounce
threshold (corresponding to the value of the DEB_STEP[2:0] bits of the PEDO_DEB_REG register).

Basically, three different scenarios are possible for the significant motion threshold value:

**a.** If the pedometer debounce functionality is not active, the significant motion threshold value is defined by the
SM_THS_[7:0] bits;

**b.** If the pedometer debounce functionality is active and the significant motion threshold value is equal to or
greater than the pedometer debounce value, the effective significant motion threshold value is defined by the
SM_THS_[7:0] bits;

**c.** If the pedometer debounce functionality is active and the significant motion threshold value is lower than the
pedometer debounce value, the effective significant motion threshold value is defined by the DEB_STEP[2:0] bits.

*Note: In case c), if the desired significant motion threshold is lower than the default value, the value of the*
*DEB_STEP[2:0] bits of the PEDO_DEB_REG register has to be decreased accordingly. Note that an excessive*
*reduction of the pedometer debounce threshold can cause the pedometer to report false step detections!*

A basic SW routine which shows how to enable significant motion detection is as follows:

1. Write 80h to FUNC_CFG_ACCESS // Enable access to embedded functions registers (bank A)

2. Write 08h to SM_THS // Set significant motion threshold

3. Write 00h to FUNC_CFG_ACCESS // Disable access to embedded functions registers (bank A)

// Turn on the accelerometer

4. Write 20h to CTRL1_XL

// ODR_XL = 26 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*

// Enable embedded functions

5. Write 05h to CTRL10_C

// Enable significant motion detection

6. Write 40h to INT1_CTRL // Significant motion interrupt driven to INT1 pin

In this example the SM_THS_[7:0] bits of the SM_THS register are set to 00001000b, therefore the significant
motion threshold is equal to 8.

**Relative tilt**

**6.3** **Relative tilt**

The tilt function allows detecting when an activity change occurs (e.g. when phone is in a front pocket and the
user goes from sitting to standing or from standing to sitting): in the LSM6DSL device it has been implemented in
hardware using only the accelerometer.

In order to enable the tilt detector it is necessary to set to 1 both the FUNC_EN and the TILT_EN bits of the
CTRL10_C register.

If the device is configured for tilt event detection, an interrupt is generated when the device is tilted by an angle
greater than 35 degrees from the start position. The start position is defined as the position of the device when the
tilt detection is enabled or the position of the device when the last tilt interrupt was generated.

After this function is enabled, for the generation of the first tilt interrupt the device should be continuously tilted by
an angle greater than 35 degrees from the start position for a period of time of 2 seconds. After the first tilt
interrupt is generated, the tilt interrupt signal is set high as soon as the device is tilted by an angle greater than 35
degrees from the position of the device corresponding to the last interrupt detection (no need to wait 2 seconds).

In the example shown in Figure 21. Tilt example tilt detection is enabled when the device orientation corresponds
to “start position #0”: the first interrupt is generated if the device is rotated by an angle greater than 35 degrees
from the start position and remains in the blue zone for a period of time of at least 2 seconds. After the first tilt
detection interrupt is generated, the new start position (#1) corresponds to the position of the device when the
previous interrupt was generated (final position #0), and the next interrupt signal will be generated as soon as the
device is tilted by an angle greater than 35 degrees, entering the blue zone surrounding the start position #1.

This interrupt signal can be driven to the two interrupt pins by setting to 1 the INT1_TILT bit of the MD1_CFG
register or the INT2_TILT bit of the MD2_CFG register; it can also be checked by reading the TILT_IA bit of the
FUNC_SRC1 register.

If latched mode is disabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 0), the interrupt signal generated by the tilt function is
pulsed: the duration of the pulse observed on the interrupt pins is about 150 µs; the duration of the pulse
observed on the TILT_IA bit of FUNC_SRC1 register is 1/26 Hz.

If latched mode is enabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 1) and the interrupt signal is driven to the interrupt pins,
once a tilt is detected, a reading of the FUNC_SRC1 register clears the request on both the pins and the TILT_IA
bit of FUNC_SRC1 register, and the device is ready to recognize the next tilt event. If latched mode is enabled but
the interrupt signal is not driven to the interrupt pins, the interrupt signal observed on the TILT_IA bit of the
FUNC_SRC1 register is pulsed, with a fixed duration of 1/26 Hz.

The tilt function works at 26 Hz, so the accelerometer ODR must be set at a value of 26 Hz or higher.

Hereafter a basic SW routine which shows how to enable the tilt detection function:

// Turn on the accelerometer


1. Write 20h to CTRL1_XL


// ODR_XL = 26 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*

**Absolute wrist tilt**


2. Write 0Ch to CTRL10_C


// Enable embedded functions

// Enable tilt detection


3. Write 02h to MD1_CFG // Tilt detector interrupt driven to INT1 pin

**6.4** **Absolute wrist tilt**

The LSM6DSL device implements in hardware the Absolute Wrist Tilt (AWT) function: it allows detecting when the
angle between a selectable accelerometer semi-axis and the horizontal plane becomes higher than a specific
user-selectable value.

The AWT function is based on the accelerometer sensor only and works at 26 Hz: in order to use it, the
accelerometer ODR must be set at a value of 26 Hz or higher.

It is possible to enable the AWT function by setting the FUNC_EN and the WRIST_TILT_EN bits of the
CTRL10_C register to 1.

If the device is configured for absolute wrist tilt event detection, an interrupt is generated when the device is tilted
by an angle greater than a configurable threshold for a minimum configurable time: the AWT interrupt signal is
generated if the tilt angle is higher than the threshold angle for a period of time equal to or higher than the latency
period.

By default, the AWT interrupt is applied to the positive X-axis. It can be driven to the INT2 interrupt pin by setting
the INT2_WRIST_TILT bit of the DRDY_PULSE_CFG register to 1 and it can be also checked by reading the
WRIST_TILT_IA bit of the FUNC_SRC2 register (this reading clears the interrupt signal if latched by setting the
LIR bit of the register TAP_CFG to 1).

If latched mode is disabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 0), the interrupt signal generated by the AWT function is
pulsed: the duration of the pulse observed on the interrupt pins is about 150 µs; the duration of the pulse
observed on the WRIST_TILT_IA bit of the FUNC_SRC2 register is 1/26 Hz.

If latched mode is enabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 1) and the interrupt signal is driven to the interrupt pins,
once a wrist tilt is detected, a reading of the FUNC_SRC2 register clears the request on both the pins and the
WRIST_TILT_IA bit of FUNC_SRC2 register, and the device is ready to recognize the next wrist tilt event. If
latched mode is enabled but the interrupt signal is not driven to the interrupt pins, the interrupt signal observed on
the WRIST_TILT_IA bit of the FUNC_SRC2 register is pulsed, with a fixed duration of 1/26 Hz.

A basic routine to enable the default configuration of AWT function is as follows:

// Turn on the accelerometer


1. Write 20h to CTRL1_XL

2. Write 84h to CTRL10_C


// ODR_XL = 26 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*

// Enable embedded functions

// Enable AWT detection


3. Write 01h to DRDY_PULSE_CFG // AWT interrupt driven to the INT2 pin

It is possible to tune the latency value, the threshold and the axes mask through the three related embedded
functions registers (bank B): A_WRIST_TILT_LAT, A_WRIST_TILT_THS and A_WRIST_TILT_Mask.

The latency parameter can be modified through the embedded register A_WRIST_TILT_LAT by setting the
WRIST_TILT_TIMER field: 1 LSB = 40 ms and the default value is 0Fh, which means 600 ms.

The threshold parameter can be configured through the embedded functions register A_WRIST_TILT_THS by
setting the WRIST_TILT_THS field. It is full-scale independent. 1 LSB corresponds to 15.625 m *g* and the
WRIST_TILT_THS field must be < 40h (64d). The tilt angle with respect to the horizontal plane can be calculated
as follows:

angle deg = [180] π [* asin] [WRIST] [_] 64 [TILT] [_] [THS]

The default value of register 54h is 20h = 32d = 500 m *g*, corresponding to a tilt angle of 30 degrees.

The user can select the axes to be considered by the AWT algorithm by configuring the bits
WRIST_TILT_MASK_Xpos, WRIST_TILT_MASK_Xneg, WRIST_TILT_MASK_Ypos, WRIST_TILT_MASK_Yneg,
WRIST_TILT_MASK_Zpos, WRIST_TILT_MASK_Zneg of the embedded register A_WRIST_TILT_Mask; the

~~**AN50**~~ **4** ~~**0**~~ - ~~**Rev**~~ **3** **p** **age** ~~**55/108**~~

**Absolute wrist tilt**

default configuration is X-positive axis AWT detection. Another or additional semi-axes can be selected in order to
change/modify the AWT detection: the OR combination of these bits is applied.

*Note: These embedded functions registers (bank B) are reset to their default value every time the accelerometer*
*exits Power-Down mode, so they have to be reconfigured every time the power mode is switched from Power-*
*Down to an active mode.*

The complete AWT configuration procedure, to be repeated when the accelerometer exits from Power-Down
mode, is the following:

// Turn on the accelerometer


1. Write 20h to CTRL1_XL


// ODR_XL = 26 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*


2. Write 04h to CTRL10_C // Enable embedded functions

3. Wait 50 ms

4. Write 00h to CTRL10_C // Disable embedded functions

5. Write A0h to FUNC_CFG_ACCESS // Enable access to embedded registers (bank B)

6. Set new latency in A_WRIST_TILT_LAT

7. Set new threshold in A_WRIST_TILT_THS

8. Set new mask in A_WRIST_TILT_Mask

9. Write 00h to FUNC_CFG_ACCESS // Disable access to embedded registers (bank B)

// Enable embedded functions


10. Write 84h to CTRL10_C


// Enable AWT detection


11. Write 01h to DRDY_PULSE_CFG // AWT interrupt driven to the INT2 pin

**AN5040**

**Timestamp**

**6.5** **Timestamp**

Together with sensor data the LSM6DSL device can provide timestamp information.

If both the accelerometer and the gyroscope are in Power-Down mode, the timestamp counter does not work.

To enable this functionality the TIMER_EN bit of the CTRL10_C register has to be set to 1: the time step count is
given by the concatenation of the TIMESTAMP_REG2 & TIMESTAMP_REG1 & TIMESTAMP_REG0 registers
and is represented as a 24-bit unsigned number.

The timestamp resolution can be configured using the TIMER_HR bit of the WAKE_UP_DUR register: when this
bit is set to 0, 1 LSB of the time step count corresponds to 6.4 ms (low-resolution mode); when this bit is set to 1,
1 LSB of the time step count corresponds to 25 µs (high-resolution mode).

When the maximum value 16777215 LSB (corresponding to FFFFFFh) is reached, the counter is automatically
reset to 000000h and continues to count. The timer count can be reset to zero at any time by writing the reset
value AAh in the TIMESTAMP_REG2 register.

An interrupt is generated around 1.638 seconds before timer saturation in both high-resolution mode (when the
timer step count reaches the value FF0000h) and low-resolution mode (when the timer step count reaches the
value FFFF00h). This interrupt signal can be driven to the INT1 pin by setting the INT1_TIMER bit of the
MD1_CFG register to 1. Once the interrupt pin is asserted, it must be reset to 0 by writing AAh in the
TIMESTAMP_REG2 register (the timer step count will also be reset).

The timestamp count can be stored in FIFO as a fourth data set along with the step counter data (see Section
8.8 Step counter and timestamp data in FIFO for details).

The timestamp resolution has to be set before enabling the timestamp functionality; a basic SW routine is as
follows:

// Turn on the accelerometer


1. Write 50h to CTRL1_XL


// ODR_XL = 208 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*


2. Write 10h to WAKE_UP_DUR // Timestamp resolution = 25 µs

3. Write 20h to CTRL10_C // Enable timestamp count

4. Write 01h to MD1_CFG // End counter interrupt driven to INT1 pin

When switching from a low timestamp resolution to a high resolution, the timer count must be reset as indicated in
the example below:

// Turn on the accelerometer


1. Write 50h to CTRL1_XL


// ODR_XL = 208 Hz, FS_XL = ±2 *g*


2. Write 00h to WAKE_UP_DUR // Timestamp resolution = 6.4 ms

3. Write 20h to CTRL10_C // Enable timestamp count

...

N Write 10h to WAKE_UP_DUR // Timestamp resolution = 25 µs

N+1 Write AAh to TIMESTAMP_REG2 // Reset timer counter

**Mode 2 - Sensor hub mode**
## **7 Mode 2 - Sensor hub mode**

The hardware flexibility of the LSM6DSL allows connecting the pins with different mode connections to external
sensors to expand functionalities such as adding a sensor hub. When sensor hub mode (Mode 2) is enabled, both
the primary I [2] C/SPI (3- and 4-wire) slave interface and the I [2] C master interface for the connection of external
sensors are available. Mode 2 connection mode is described in detail in the following paragraphs.

**7.1** **Sensor hub mode description**

In sensor hub mode (Mode 2) up to 4 external sensors can be connected to the I [2] C master interface of the
LSM6DSL device. The sensor hub trigger signal can be synchronized with the accelerometer data-ready signal
(up to 104 Hz); alternatively, an external signal connected to the INT2 pin can be used as the sensor hub trigger.
In this second case, the maximum ODR supported for external sensors depends on the number of read / write
operations that can be executed between two consecutive trigger signals.

On the sensor hub trigger signal, all the write and read I²C operations configured through the registers
SLVx_ADD, SLVx_SUBADD, SLAVEx_CONFIG and DATAWRITE_SRC_MODE_SUB_SLV0 are performed
sequentially from external sensor 0 to external sensor 3 (depending on the external sensors enabled through the
Aux_sens_on[1:0] field in the SLAVE0_CONFIG register).

External sensor data can also be stored in FIFO with a configurable decimation factor (see Section 8 First-in firstout (FIFO) buffer for details).

If both the accelerometer and the gyroscope are in Power-Down mode, the sensor hub does not work.

All external sensors have to be connected in parallel to the SDx/SCx pins of the device, as illustrated in Figure
22. External sensor connections in Mode 2 for a single external sensor.

External pull-up resistors and the external trigger signal connection are optional and depend on the configuration
of the registers.

**Sensor hub mode registers**


**7.2** **Sensor hub mode registers**

In order to enable the embedded functionalities of the LSM6DSL, the FUNC_EN bit of the CTRL10_C register has
to be set to 1; after enabling the embedded functionalities, the MASTER_CONFIG register has to be used for the
configuration of the I [2] C master interface.

A set of registers SLVx_ADD, SLVx_SUBADD, SLAVEx_CONFIG is dedicated to the configuration of the 4 slave
interfaces associated to the 4 connectable external sensors. An additional register,
DATAWRITE_SRC_MODE_SUB_SLV0, is associated to slave #0 only: it can be used to implement the writing
and the source mode conditioned reading of the registers of the external sensor associated to slave #0.

Finally, 18 registers (from SENSORHUB1_REG to SENSORHUB18_REG) are available to store the data read
from the external sensors.

**7.2.1** **CTRL10_C (19h)**

         - FUNC_EN must be set to 1 in order to enable the embedded functionalities of the LSM6DSL (pedometer, tilt,
significant motion, ironing).

**7.2.2** **MASTER_CONFIG (1Ah)**

This register is used to configure the I [2] C master interface.

to Section 7.2.3 FUNC_SRC1 (53h) for more details about the SENSORHUB_END_OP bit. If the
DRDY_PULSED bit of the DRDY_PULSE_CFG register is set to 1, the I [2] C master data-ready signal is
pulsed with a duration of 150 µs.

The START_CONFIG bit selects the sensor hub trigger signal.

         - When this bit is set to 0, the accelerometer sensor has to be active (not in Power-Down mode) and the
sensor hub trigger signal is the accelerometer data-ready signal, with a frequency corresponding to the
accelerometer ODR up to 104 Hz.

         - When this bit is set to 1, at least one sensor between the accelerometer and the gyroscope has to be active
and the sensor hub trigger signal is the INT2 pin; in fact, when both the MASTER_ON bit and
START_CONFIG bit are set to 1, the INT2 pin is configured as an input signal. In this case, the INT2 pin has
to be connected to the data-ready pin of the external sensor (Figure 22. External sensor connections in
Mode 2) in order to trigger the reading/writing operations on the external sensor registers. The sensor hub
interrupt from INT2 is ‘high-level triggered’ (not programmable).

*Note: In case of external trigger signal usage (START_CONFIG=1), if the INT2 pin is connected to the Data-*
*Ready pin of the external sensor (Figure 22. External sensor connections in Mode 2) and the latter is in Power-*
*Down mode, then no data-ready signal can be generated by the external sensor. For this reason, the initial*

**Sensor hub mode registers**

*configuration of the external sensor’s register has to be performed using the internal trigger signal*
*(START_CONFIG=0). After the external sensor is activated and the data-ready signal is available, the external*
*trigger signal can be used by switching the START_CONFIG bit to 1.*

         - PULL_UP_EN bit enables/disables the internal pull-up on the auxiliary I [2] C line. When this bit is set to 0, the
internal pull-up is disabled and the external pull-up resistors on the SDx/SCx pins are required, as shown in
Figure 22. External sensor connections in Mode 2. When this bit is set to 1, the internal pull-up is enabled
and the external pull-up resistors on the SDx/SCx pins are not required.

         - PASS_THROUGH_MODE bit is used to enable/disable the I [2] C interface pass-through. When this bit is set
to 1, the main I [2] C line (e.g. connected to an external microcontroller) is short-circuited with the auxiliary one
in order to implement a direct access to the external sensor registers. See Section 7.3 Sensor hub passthrough feature for details.

         - MASTER_ON bit has to be set to 1 to enable the auxiliary I [2] C master of the LSM6DSL device (sensor hub
mode).

         - SENSORHUB_END_OP bit reports the status of the I²C master: during the idle state of the I²C master, this
bit is equal to 1; it goes to 0 during I²C master read/write operations.

When a sensor hub routine is completed, this bit automatically goes to 1 and the external sensor data are
available to be read from the SENSORHUBx_REG registers (depending on the configuration of the
SLVx_ADD, SLVx_SUBADD, SLAVEx_CONFIG registers).

*Note: The SENSORHUB_END_OP bit is cleared by reading the FUNC_SRC1 register if the LIR bit in the*
*TAP_CFG register is set to 1, otherwise it is cleared only during an I²C master read or write operation.*

Information about the status of the I²C master can be driven to the INT1 interrupt pin by setting the
DRDY_ON_INT1 bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register to 1: if the LIR bit of the TAP_CFG register is set to
0, a pulsed interrupt signal (with typical pulse duration of about 150 µs) is generated at the rising edge of the
SENSORHUB_END_OP signal. If latched mode is enabled (LIR bit is set to 1) and the interrupt signal is
driven to the interrupt pin INT1, this interrupt signal is cleared by reading the FUNC_SRC1 register.

**Sensor hub pass-through feature**

**7.3** **Sensor hub pass-through feature**

The PASS_THROUGH_MODE bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register is used to enable/disable the I [2] C interface
pass-through: when it is set to 1, the main I [2] C line (e.g. connected to an external microcontroller) is short-circuited
with the auxiliary one in order to implement a direct access to the external sensor registers. It is recommended to
use this feature when configuring the external sensors.

**Figure 24. Pass-through feature**












Some limitations must be considered when using the sensor hub and the pass-through feature. Three different
scenarios are possible:

1. The sensor hub is used with the START_CONFIG bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register set to 0 (internal
trigger) and the pass-through feature is not used: there is no limitation on INT2 pin usage.

2. The sensor hub is used with the START_CONFIG bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register set to 0 (internal
trigger) and the pass-through feature is used: the INT2 pin must be connected to GND; it is not possible to
switch to external trigger configuration (by setting the START_CONFIG bit to 1) and the INT2 pin cannot be
used for the digital interrupts. Specific procedures have to be applied to enable/disable the pass-through
feature: they are described in Section 7.3.1 Pass-through feature enable and in Section 7.3.2 Pass-through
feature disable.

3. The sensor hub is used with the START_CONFIG bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register set to 1 (external
trigger): the pass-through feature cannot be used; the INT2 pin has to be connected to the data-ready pin of
the external sensor (trigger signal) and the procedure below has to be executed to avoid conflicts with the
INT2 line:

a. Set either the TRIG_EN or LVL1_EN or LVL2_EN bit of the CTRL6_C register to 1 (to configure the
INT2 pin as input pin);

b. Configure the external sensors (do not use the pass-through);

c. Configure the sensor hub SLAVEx registers;

d. Set the START_CONFIG bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register to 1;

e. Set the MASTER_ON bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register to 1;

f. Reset to 0 the bit in the CTRL6_C register asserted in step a.

Examples of external sensor configurations without using the pass-through are given in Section 7.4 Sensor hub
mode example and Section 7.5.4 Ironing example.

**Sensor hub mode example**

**7.3.1** **Pass-through feature enable**

When the embedded sensor hub functionality is disabled, the pass-through feature can be enabled at any time by
setting the PASS_THROUGH_MODE bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register to 1.

When the embedded sensor hub functionality is enabled, a specific procedure has to be followed to enable the
pass-through feature in order to prevent I [2] C bus arbitration loss:

1. Set the START_CONFIG bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register to 1 in order to disable the sensor hub trigger
(external trigger is enabled, but no trigger can be received on the INT2 pin since it’s connected to GND);

2. Wait at least 5 ms (running I [2] C operations will be completed);

3. Set the MASTER_ON bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register to 0 in order to disable the embedded sensor
hub;

4. Set the START_CONFIG bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register to 0 in order to restore the sensor hub
trigger;

5. Set the PULL_UP_EN bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register to 0 in order to disable the I [2] C master pull-up;

6. Set the PASS_THROUGH_MODE bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register to 1 in order to enable the passthrough feature.

**7.3.2** **Pass-through feature disable**

The procedure below has to be used in order to disable the pass-through:

1. Wait for the external microcontroller connected to the main I [2] C line to complete all running I [2] C operations.
The pass-through must not be disabled in the middle of an I [2] C transaction;

2. Set the PASS_THROUGH_MODE bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register to 0.

At this point, the internal I [2] C master pull-up can be restored by setting the PULL_UP_EN bit of the
MASTER_CONFIG register to 1, and the auxiliary I [2] C master can be enabled by setting the MASTER_ON bit of
the MASTER_CONFIG register to 1.

**7.4** **Sensor hub mode example**

The configuration of the external sensors should be performed using the pass-through feature: this feature can be
enabled by setting the PASS_THROUGH_MODE bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register to 1 and implements a
direct access to the external sensor registers, allowing quick configuration.

The code provided below gives a basic routine to configure the LSM6DSL in sensor hub mode. Furthermore, this
sequence configures the LIS2MDL external magnetometer sensor (refer to the datasheet for additional details) in
continuous mode and reads the magnetometer output registers, saving their values in the SENSORHUB1_REG
to SENSORHUB6_REG registers. The pass-through feature is not used in this example.

1. Write 80h to FUNC_CFG_ACCESS // Enable access to embedded functions registers (bank A)

// LIS2MDL slave address = 0011110b


2. Write 3Ch to SLV0_ADD


// Enable write operation (rw_0=0)


3. Write 60h to SLV0_SUBADD // 60h is the LIS2MDL register to be written

// 8Ch is the value to be written in register 60h of


4. Write 8Ch to DATAWRITE_SRC_MODE_SUB_SLV0


// LIS2MDL to configure it in continuous mode,

// ODR = 100 Hz, temperature compensation enabled


5. Write 10h to SLAVE0_CONFIG // Set Aux_sens_on bits different from 00b

6. Write 20h to SLAVE1_CONFIG // Enable write_once bit

7. Write 00h to FUNC_CFG_ACCESS // Disable access to embedded functions registers (bank A)

8. Write 04h to CTRL10_C // Enable embedded functions

**Sensor hub mode example**

// Enable internal pull-up on SDx/SCx lines

// Sensor hub trigger signal is XL Data-Ready

// Enable auxiliary I [2] C master

**Magnetometer hard-iron / soft-iron correction**

**7.5** **Magnetometer hard-iron / soft-iron correction**

The LSM6DSL device supports the data acquisition of an external magnetometer with soft-iron and hard-iron
correction features. For this purpose, it is required to set the MASTER_ON bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register
to 1 to enable the sensor hub mode, to associate the external magnetometer to slave 0 registers (SLV0_ADD,
SLV0_SUBADD and SLAVE0_CONFIG) and to set the Slave0_numop field of SLAVE0_CONFIG to 6.

The FUNC_EN bit of CTRL10_C register has to be set to 1 in order to enable the embedded ironing
functionalities. Then, distortion correction algorithms can be enabled as described in Table 48. Ironing
configuration: the IRON_EN bit of MASTER_CONFIG and the SOFT_EN bit of CTRL9_XL are used to enable
hard-iron correction only or both hard-iron and soft-iron corrections. In the latter case, both calibrated (hard-iron &
soft-iron) and uncalibrated (soft-iron only) magnetometer data are available.

**Table 48. Ironing configuration**





|CTRL9_XL<br>SOFT_EN bit|MASTER_CONFIG<br>IRON_EN bit|Ironing<br>configuration|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|No correction applied|
|0|1|Hard-iron only|
|1|1|Hard-iron + soft-iron corrections|


**7.5.1** **Hard-iron correction**

Hard-iron distortion is normally generated by ferromagnetic material with permanent magnetic fields that are part
of the object (e.g. a tablet) in use; these materials could be permanent magnets or magnetized iron or steel. They
are time invariant and deform the local geomagnetic field with different offset on different directions.

Generally, if the user performs many 3D rotations of the object in an ideal environment (no hard-iron/soft-iron
distortion) and plots the collected magnetic sensor raw data, the result will be a perfect sphere with no offset. The
hard-iron distortion effect is to offset the sphere along the X, Y and Z axes; in the X-Y plane, the hard-iron
distortion is identified by an offset of the origin of the ideal circle from (0, 0), as shown in Figure 25. Hard-iron
effect (X-Y 2D scatter plot).

**Figure 25. Hard-iron effect (X-Y 2D scatter plot)**
## X **No Distortion** **Hard-Iron Distortion** Y

In the LSM6DSL device, the 3x1 hard-iron vector containing the X, Y, Z magnetic offset values calculated by the
user have to be indicated in dedicated registers: the MAG_OFFX_L and MAG_OFFX_H registers are dedicated to
the X-axis offset, the MAG_OFFY_L and MAG_OFFY_H registers are dedicated to the Y-axis offset, the
MAG_OFFZ_L and MAG_OFFZ_H registers are dedicated to the Z-axis offset. These registers values are

expressed as a 16-bit word in two’s complement; the sensitivity [LSB/Gauss] to be applied to calculate the hardiron register values corresponds to that of the external magnetometer.

The hard-iron registers are accessible when the FUNC_CFG_EN bit of the FUNC_CFG_ACCESS register is set
to 1. In order to enable the hard-iron correction algorithm, it is necessary to set to 1 both the FUNC_EN bit of the
CTRL10_C register and the IRON_EN bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register (Table 48. Ironing configuration).

**7.5.2** **Soft-iron correction**

Soft-iron distortion is generated by magnetically soft materials or current carrying PCB traces. While the hard-iron
distortion is constant regardless of the orientation, the soft-iron distortion changes with the orientation of the
object in the Earth’s field. Basically, the local geomagnetic field is deformed by different gain on different
directions.

The effect of the soft-iron distortion is to make the ideal full round sphere become a tilted ellipsoid; in the X-Y
plane, the soft-iron distortion is identified by a tilted ellipse with the origin in (0, 0), as shown in Figure 25. Hardiron effect (X-Y 2D scatter plot).

**Figure 26. Soft-iron effect (X-Y 2D scatter plot)**
## X No Distortion Soft-Iron Distortion Y

In the LSM6DSL device, the 3x3 soft-iron transformation matrix calculated by the user has to be indicated in 9
dedicated registers: MAG_SI_XX, MAG_SI_XY, MAG_SI_XZ, MAG_SI_YX, MAG_SI_YY, MAG_SI_YZ,
MAG_SI_ZX, MAG_SI_ZY, MAG_SI_ZZ. These register values are expressed as an 8-bit word in sign-magnitude
format; for these registers 1 LSB corresponds to 1/8, so the matrix parameters calculated by the user must be
multiplied by 8 before writing them in the soft-iron registers.

The soft-iron registers are accessible when the FUNC_CFG_EN bit of the FUNC_CFG_ACCESS register is set to
1. In order to enable the soft-iron correction algorithm it is necessary to set to 1 the FUNC_EN bit of the
CTRL10_C register, the IRON_EN bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register and the SOFT_EN bit of the CTRL9_XL
register (Table 48. Ironing configuration).

**Magnetometer hard-iron / soft-iron correction**

**7.5.3** **Getting compensated magnetometer data**

The status of magnetometer data acquisition and hard-iron/soft-iron correction can be checked using the
FUNC_SRC1 register:

         - SENSORHUB_END_OP bit is set high when the sensor hub routine has completed. The acquired
magnetometer raw data are available in registers from address 66h (OUT_MAG_RAW_X_L) to 6Bh
(OUT_MAG_RAW_Z_H).

         - SI_END_OP bit is set high when the execution of the enabled hard-iron and soft-iron algorithms has
completed. If the soft-iron correction is enabled, the magnetometer uncalibrated data (with soft-iron only
applied) are available in registers from address 4Dh (SENSORHUB13_REG) to 52h
(SENSORHUB18_REG). The magnetometer calibrated data, with both hard-iron (if enabled) and soft-iron (if
enabled) correction, are available in registers from address 2Eh (SENSORHUB1_REG) to 33h
(SENSORHUB6_REG).

If latched mode is disabled (LIR bit of TAP_CFG is set to 0), the SENSORHUB_END_OP and SI_END_OP bits
are active only for 1/100 Hz, then they are automatically deasserted. If latched mode is enabled, these two bits
are cleared by reading the FUNC_SRC1 register.

The SENSORHUB_END_OP signal can be driven to the INT1 interrupt pin by setting the DRDY_ON_INT1 bit of
the MASTER_CONFIG register to 1. The SI_END_OP signal can be driven to the INT2 interrupt pin by setting the
INT2_IRON bit of the MD2_CFG register to 1.

A schematic representation of hard-iron and soft-iron correction feature is illustrated in Figure 27. Hard-iron / softiron correction block scheme below.

If the soft-iron correction is enabled and the soft-iron registers still have the default zero value, then the
magnetometer calibrated data and the magnetometer uncalibrated data will also be equal to zero. As a
consequence, when the soft-iron correction is enabled, the soft-iron transformation matrix must be at least
initialized to the identity matrix multiplied by 8, setting the value of the MAG_SI_XX, MAG_SI_YY and
MAG_SI_ZZ registers to 08h.

**7.5.4** **Ironing example**

The following example demonstrates how to define the values to be assigned to hard-iron and soft-iron correction
registers starting from the calculated hard-iron vector and soft-iron rotation matrix. This example refers to the
usage of the LIS2MDL magnetometer sensor.

         - Hard-iron (X,Y,Z) offset values vector (gauss):

−0.335605

HI 3x1 = 0.126487

−0.114722

These three offset values must be divided by the LIS2MDL sensitivity value (0.0015 gauss / LSB) in order the get
the LSB values to be written in the hard-iron correction registers (Table 49. Hard-iron register values).

**Table 49. Hard-iron register values**

|Col1|Offset values [LSB]|Register values|
|---|---|---|
|X|-224 (FF20h)|MAG_OFFX_H = FFh<br>MAG_OFFX_L = 20h|
|Y|84 (0054h)|MAG_OFFY_H = 00h<br>MAG_OFFY_L = 54h|
|Z|-76 (FFB4h)|MAG_OFFZ_H = FFh<br>MAG_OFFZ_L = B4h|



         - Soft-iron rotation matrix:

1.229006 0.173917 0.052327

SI 3x3 = 0.173917 1.033307 −0.130089

0.052327 −0.130089 1.243645

These soft-iron matrix elements must be multiplied by 8 in order to get the LSB values to be written in the soft-iron
correction registers (Table 50. Soft-iron register values). LSB values are expressed in sign-magnitude format.

**Table 50. Soft-iron register values**

|Col1|Soft-iron matrix elements|Register values|
|---|---|---|
|XX|+1.229006|MAG_SI_XX = 0Ah|
|XY|+0.173917|MAG_SI_XY = 01h|
|XZ|+0.052327|MAG_SI_XZ = 00h|
|YX|+0.173917|MAG_SI_YX = 01h|
|YY|+1.033307|MAG_SI_YY = 08h|
|YZ|-0.130089|MAG_SI_YZ = 81h|
|ZX|+0.052327|MAG_SI_ZX = 00h|
|ZY|-0.130089|MAG_SI_ZY = 81h|

**First-in first-out (FIFO) buffer**
## **8 First-in first-out (FIFO) buffer**

In order to limit intervention by the host processor and facilitate post-processing data for event recognition, the
LSM6DSL embeds a 4 kB first-in first-out buffer (FIFO).

The FIFO can be configured to store the following data:

         - gyroscope sensor data;

         - accelerometer sensor data;

         - external sensor (connected to sensor hub interface) data;

         - step counter and timestamp data;

         - temperature sensor data.

Saving data in the FIFO buffer is based on four ‘FIFO data sets’ consisting of 6 bytes each:

         - The 1 [st] FIFO data set is reserved for gyroscope data;

         - The 2 [nd] FIFO data set is reserved for accelerometer data;

         - The 3 [rd] FIFO data set is reserved for the external sensor data stored in the registers from
SENSORHUB1_REG to SENSORHUB6_REG (see Section 7.2.10 SENSORHUBx_REG registers for
details on the SENSORHUBx_REG);

         - The 4 [th] FIFO data set can be alternately associated to the external sensor data stored in the registers from
SENSORHUB7_REG to SENSORHUB12_REG, to the step counter and timestamp info, or to the
temperature sensor data.

All these data sets can be stored in FIFO at different ODRs, by setting the decimation factors in the FIFO_CTRL3
and FIFO_CTRL4 registers. Decimation factors are also used to select which FIFO data sets have to be stored in
FIFO.

Five different FIFO operating modes can be chosen through the FIFO_MODE_[2:0] bits of the FIFO_CTRL5
register:

         - Bypass mode;

         - FIFO mode;

         - Continuous mode;

         - Continuous-to-FIFO mode;

         - Bypass-to-Continuous mode.

*Note: When the FIFO is used, the IF_INC and BDU bits of the CTRL3_C register must be equal to 1.*

Data are retrieved from the FIFO through two dedicated registers: FIFO_DATA_OUT_L and FIFO_DATA_OUT_H.
In this way, data can be read either from the FIFO (at a slower ODR) or from the device output registers (at the
normal ODR).

To monitor the FIFO status (full, empty, number of samples stored, etc.), four dedicated registers are available:
FIFO_STATUS1, FIFO_STATUS2, FIFO_STATUS3, FIFO_STATUS4.

Programmable FIFO thresholds can be set in FIFO_CTRL1 and FIFO_CTRL2 using the FTH_[10:0] bits.

FIFO full, FIFO threshold and FIFO overrun events can be enabled to generate dedicated interrupts on the two
interrupt pins (INT1 and INT2) through the INT1_FULL_FLAG, INT1_FTH and INT1_FIFO_OVR bits of the
INT1_CTRL register, and through the INT2_FULL_FLAG, INT2_FTH and INT2_FIFO_OVR bits of the
INT2_CTRL register.

In order to increase the number of samples which can be stored in the FIFO, it is also possible to store (as 1st
FIFO data set) only the 8 most significant bits of the accelerometer and gyroscope data by setting the bit
ONLY_HIGH_DATA in the FIFO_CTRL4 register.

Writing data in the FIFO can be triggered by the accelerometer/gyroscope data-ready; it can also be triggered by
the sensor hub data-ready (corresponding to the behavior of the SENSORHUB_END_OP bit of FUNC_SRC1
register): in this case the DATA_VALID_SEL_FIFO bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register must be set to 1.
Moreover, if DATA_VALID_SEL_FIFO is set to 0 and the TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_DRDY bit of the FIFO_CTRL2
register is set to 1, data are stored in FIFO every time a step is detected.

**FIFO registers**

**8.1** **FIFO registers**

The FIFO buffer is managed by:

         - five control registers (from FIFO_CTRL1 to FIFO_CTRL5);

         - four status registers (from FIFO_STATUS1 to FIFO_STATUS4);

         - two data output registers (FIFO_DATA_OUT_L and FIFO_DATA_OUT_H);

         - some additional bits to enable threshold usage (STOP_ON_FTH) and route FIFO full, threshold or overrun
events to the two interrupt lines (bits: INT1_FULL_FLAG, INT2_FULL_FLAG, INT1_FTH, INT2_FTH,
INT1_FIFO_OVR, INT2_FIFO_OVR).

**8.1.1** **FIFO_CTRL1 (06h)**

The FIFO_CTRL1 register contains the lower part of the 11-bit FIFO threshold level. For the complete threshold
level configuration, consider also the FTH_[10:8] bits of the FIFO_CTRL2 register. The value of the FIFO
threshold level is referred to data having 16-bit format.

The FIFO watermark flag (WaterM bit in FIFO_STATUS2 register) rises when the number of bytes stored in the
FIFO is equal to or higher than the threshold level.

In order to limit the FIFO depth to the watermark level, the STOP_ON_FTH bit must be set to 1 in the
FIFO_CTRL4 register.

         - TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_EN enables step counter and timestamp data to be stored as the 4th FIFO data set.
The content of the 6 bytes stored in the FIFO when this bit is set to 1 is described in Section 8.8 Step
counter and timestamp data in FIFO.

         - TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_DRDY. When this bit is set to 1 and the DATA_VALID_SEL_FIFO bit in the
MASTER_CONFIG register is set to 0, all the data are stored in the FIFO every time a new step has been
detected by the step counter. See Section 8.3 Setting the FIFO trigger, FIFO ODR and decimation factors for
details.

         - FIFO_TEMP_EN bit enables temperature data to be stored as the 4th FIFO data set. The content of the 6
bytes stored in the FIFO when this bit is set to 1 is described in Section 8.9 Temperature data in FIFO.

         - FTH_[10:8] contains the upper part of the FIFO threshold level. For the complete threshold level
configuration, consider also the FTH_[7:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL1 register.

**8.1.3** **FIFO_CTRL3 (08h)**

The FIFO_CTRL3 register contains the accelerometer and gyroscope FIFO decimation factors, used to choose if
the data of these sensors have to be stored in the FIFO and at which rate they are stored.

When the DEC_FIFO_GYRO[2:0] bits are set to 000b, the 1st FIFO data set (reserved for gyroscope data) is not
stored in the FIFO. When the DEC_FIFO_XL[2:0] bits are set to 000b, the 2nd FIFO data set (reserved for
accelerometer data) is not stored in the FIFO.

The FIFO_CTRL4 register contains the decimation factors used to define at which data rate the data associated
to the 3rd FIFO and the 4th FIFO data sets are stored in the FIFO.

When the DEC_DS3_FIFO[2:0] bits are set to 000b, the 3rd FIFO data set is not stored in the FIFO. When the
DEC_DS4_FIFO[2:0] bits are set to 000b, the 4th FIFO data set is not stored in the FIFO.

The FIFO_CTRL4 register also contains the bit ONLY_HIGH_DATA, which allows storing in the FIFO only the
upper part (Most Significant Byte) of the accelerometer and gyroscope data in order to increase the maximum
number of accelerometer and gyroscope samples in the FIFO. See Section 8.7 High part of gyroscope and
accelerometer data for more details about this functionality.

The FIFO_CTRL4 register contains the bit STOP_ON_FTH, which allows limiting the FIFO depth to the
watermark level.

**8.1.5** **FIFO_CTRL5 (0Ah)**

The FIFO_CTRL5 register contains the FIFO operating mode bits (FIFO_MODE_[2:0]) and the FIFO output data
rate bits (ODR_FIFO_[3:0]).

FIFO operating modes are described in Section 8.2 FIFO modes.

When the internal trigger (accelerometer/gyroscope data-ready) is used, the ODR_FIFO_[3:0] bits define the
maximum data rate at which data are stored in FIFO. Data can be stored in FIFO at a lower data rate using the
FIFO decimation factors. For more information about FIFO trigger and FIFO ODR configuration see Section
8.3 Setting the FIFO trigger, FIFO ODR and decimation factors.

*Note: When the FIFO is used, the IF_INC bit of the CTRL3_C register must be equal to 1.*

**8.1.6** **FIFO_STATUS1 (3Ah)**

The FIFO_STATUS1 register, together with the FIFO_STATUS2 register, provides information about the number
of samples stored in the FIFO. Each sample is represented as 16-bit data.

**Table 62. FIFO_STATUS1 register**

**8.1.7** **FIFO_STATUS2 (3Bh)**

The FIFO_STATUS2 register, together with the FIFO_STATUS1 register, provides information about the number
of samples stored in the FIFO and about the current status (watermark, overrun, full, empty) of the FIFO buffer.

**Table 63. FIFO_STATUS2 register**

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|WaterM|OVER_RUN|FIFO_FULL_<br>SMART|FIFO_<br>EMPTY|0|DIFF_<br>FIFO_10|DIFF_<br>FIFO_9|DIFF_<br>FIFO_8|



- WaterM represents the watermark status. This bit is set high when the number of bytes already stored in the
FIFO is equal to or higher than the watermark level (each sample is represented as 16-bit data). The
watermark status can be driven to the two interrupt pins by setting to 1 the INT1_FTH bit of the INT1_CTRL
register or the INT2_FTH bit of the INT2_CTRL register.

- OVER_RUN is set high when the FIFO is completely filled and at least one sample has already been
overwritten to store the new data. This signal can be driven to the two interrupt pins by setting to 1 the
INT1_FIFO_OVR bit of the INT1_CTRL register or the INT2_FIFO_OVR bit of the INT2_CTRL register.

- FIFO_FULL_SMART is set high when the next set of data that will be stored in FIFO will make the FIFO full.
This signal can be driven to the two interrupt pins by setting to 1 the INT1_FULL_FLAG bit of the
INT1_CTRL register or the INT2_FULL_FLAG bit of the INT2_CTRL register.

- FIFO_EMPTY is set high when the FIFO is empty.

- DIFF_FIFO_[10:8] contains the upper part of the number of unread words (16-bit data) stored in the FIFO.
The lower part is represented by the DIFF_FIFO_[7:0] bits in FIFO_STATUS1. The value of
DIFF_FIFO_[10:0] field corresponds to the number of samples in the FIFO (each sample is represented as
16-bit data). When a FIFO overrun event occurs (OVER_RUN bit is set high), the value of the
DIFF_FIFO_[10:0] field is set to 0.

Register content is updated synchronously to the FIFO write and read operations, as illustrated in Table
64. FIFO_STATUS2 behavior (case with one sensor in FIFO, STOP_ON_FTH = 0).

**FIFO modes**

**8.2** **FIFO modes**

The LSM6DSL FIFO buffer can be configured to operate in five different modes selectable through the
FIFO_MODE_[2:0] field of the FIFO_CTRL5 register. The available configurations ensure a high level of flexibility
and extend the number of functions usable in application development.

Bypass, FIFO, Continuous, Continuous-to-FIFO and Bypass-to-Continuous modes are described in the following
paragraphs.

*Note: When the FIFO is used, the IF_INC bit of the CTRL3_C register must be equal to 1.*

**8.2.1** **Bypass mode**

When Bypass mode is enabled, the FIFO is not used, the buffer content is cleared, and it remains empty until
another mode is selected.

Bypass mode is selected when the FIFO_MODE_[2:0] bits are set to 000b. When this mode is enabled, the
FIFO_STATUS2 register contains the value 10h (FIFO empty).

Bypass mode must be used in order to stop and reset the FIFO buffer when a different mode is operating. Note
that by placing the FIFO buffer into Bypass mode, the whole buffer content is cleared.

**8.2.2** **FIFO mode**

In FIFO mode, the buffer continues filling until it becomes full. Then it stops collecting data and the FIFO content
remains unchanged until a different mode is selected.

Follow these steps for FIFO mode configuration (if the accelerometer/gyroscope data-ready is used as the FIFO
trigger):

1. Choose the decimation factor for each sensor through the decimation bits in the FIFO_CTRL3 and
FIFO_CTRL4 registers (see Section 8.3 Setting the FIFO trigger, FIFO ODR and decimation factors for
details);

2. Choose the FIFO ODR through the ODR_FIFO_[3:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL5 register;

3. Set the FIFO_MODE_[2:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL5 register to 001b to enable FIFO mode.

When this mode is selected, the FIFO starts collecting data. The FIFO_STATUS1 and FIFO_STATUS2 registers
are updated according to the number of samples stored.

When the next stored set of data will make the FIFO full, the FIFO_FULL_SMART bit of the FIFO_STATUS2
register is set to 1 and no more data are stored in the FIFO buffer. Data can be retrieved after the
FIFO_FULL_SMART event by reading the FIFO_DATA_OUT_L and FIFO_DATA_OUT_H registers for the
number of times specified by the DIFF_FIFO_[10:0] bits of the FIFO_STATUS1 and FIFO_STATUS2 registers.

Using the WaterM bit of the FIFO_STATUS2 register, data can also be retrieved when a threshold level
(FTH_[10:0] in FIFO_CTRL1 and FIFO_CTRL2 registers) is reached if the application requires a lower number of
samples in the FIFO.

If the STOP_ON_FTH bit of the FIFO_CTRL4 register is set to 1, the FIFO size is limited to the value of the
FTH_[10:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL1 and FIFO_CTRL2 registers: in this case, the FIFO_FULL_SMART bit of the
FIFO_STATUS2 register is set high when the number of samples in FIFO will reach or exceed the FTH_[10:0]
value on the next FIFO write operation.

Communication speed is not very important in FIFO mode because the data collection is stopped and there is no
risk of overwriting data already acquired. Before restarting the FIFO mode, it is necessary to set to Bypass mode
first in order to completely clear the FIFO content.

Figure 28. FIFO mode (STOP_ON_FTH = 0) shows an example of FIFO mode usage. In the example X-Y-Z data
(green cells indicate the sample number) from just one sensor are stored in the FIFO. In these conditions, the
number of 16-bit samples that can be stored in the FIFO buffer is 2046.

In Continuous mode, the FIFO continues filling. When the buffer is full, the FIFO index restarts from the
beginning, and older data are replaced by the new data. The oldest values continue to be overwritten until a read
operation frees FIFO slots. The host processor’s reading speed is important in order to free slots faster than new
data is made available. To stop this configuration, Bypass mode must be selected.

Follow these steps for Continuous mode configuration (if the accelerometer/gyroscope data-ready is used as the
FIFO trigger):

1. Choose the decimation factor for each sensor through the decimation bits in the FIFO_CTRL3 and
FIFO_CTRL4 registers (see Section 8.3 Setting the FIFO trigger, FIFO ODR and decimation factors for
details);

2. Choose the FIFO ODR through the ODR_FIFO_[3:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL5 register;

3. Set the FIFO_MODE_[2:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL5 register to 110b to enable FIFO Continuous mode.

When this mode is selected, the FIFO collects data continuously. The FIFO_STATUS1 and FIFO_STATUS2
registers are updated according to the number of samples stored.

When the next stored set of data will make the FIFO full, the FIFO_FULL_SMART bit of the FIFO_STATUS2
register is set to 1. The OVER_RUN bit in the FIFO_STATUS2 register indicates when at least one sample has
been overwritten to store the new data.

Data can be retrieved after the FIFO_FULL_SMART event by reading the FIFO_DATA_OUT_L and
FIFO_DATA_OUT_H registers for the number of times specified by the DIFF_FIFO_[10:0] bits in the
FIFO_STATUS1 and FIFO_STATUS2 registers.

Using the WaterM bit of the FIFO_STATUS2 register, data can also be retrieved when a threshold level
(FTH_[10:0] in FIFO_CTRL1 and FIFO_CTRL2 registers) is reached.

If the STOP_ON_FTH bit of FIFO_CTRL4 register is set to 1, the FIFO size is limited to the value of the
FTH_[10:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL1 and FIFO_CTRL2 registers: in this case, the FIFO_FULL_SMART bit of the
FIFO_STATUS2 register is set high when the number of samples in FIFO will reach the FTH_[10:0] value on the
next FIFO write operation.

It is recommended to read faster than 1*ODR at least three times the number of the enabled FIFO data set in
order to free FIFO slots for the new data: this allows avoiding loss of data.

Figure 29. Continuous mode shows an example of the Continuous mode usage. In the example, X-Y-Z data
(green cells indicate the sample number) from just one sensor are stored in the FIFO and the FIFO samples are
read faster than 1 * ODR so that no data is lost. In these conditions, the number of 16-bit samples stored is 2046.

This mode is a combination of the Continuous and FIFO modes previously described. In Continuous-to-FIFO
mode, the FIFO buffer starts operating in Continuous mode and switches to FIFO mode when an event condition

occurs.

The event condition can be one of the following:

         - Significant motion: event detection has to be configured and the INT1_SIG_MOT bit of the INT1_CTRL
register has to be set to 1;

         - Tilt: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_TILT bit of the MD2_CFG register has to be set to 1;

         - Step detection: event detection has to be configured and the INT1_STEP_DETECTOR bit of the
INT1_CTRL register has to be set to 1;

         - Single tap: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_SINGLE_TAP bit of the MD2_CFG register
has to be set to 1;

         - Double tap: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_DOUBLE_TAP bit of the MD2_CFG register
has to be set to 1;

         - Free-fall: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_FF bit of the MD2_CFG register has to be set
to 1;

         - Wake-up: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_WU bit of the MD2_CFG register has to be set
to 1;

         - 6D: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_6D bit of the MD2_CFG register has to be set to 1.

Continuous-to-FIFO mode is sensitive to the edge of the interrupt signal: at the first interrupt event, FIFO changes
from Continuous mode to FIFO mode and maintains it until Bypass mode is set.

Follow these steps for Continuous-to-FIFO mode configuration (if the accelerometer/gyroscope data-ready is
used as the FIFO trigger):

1. Configure one of the events as previously described;

2. Choose the decimation factor for each sensor through the decimation bits in the FIFO_CTRL3 and
FIFO_CTRL4 registers (see Section 8.3 Setting the FIFO trigger, FIFO ODR and decimation factors for
details);

3. Choose the FIFO ODR through the ODR_FIFO_[3:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL5 register;

4. Set the FIFO_MODE_[2:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL5 register to 011b to enable FIFO Continuous-to-FIFO
mode.

In Continuous-to-FIFO mode the FIFO buffer continues filling; when the next stored set of data will make the FIFO
full, the FIFO_FULL_SMART bit is set high.

If the STOP_ON_FTH bit of the FIFO_CTRL4 register is set to 1, the FIFO size is limited to the value of the
FTH_[10:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL1 and FIFO_CTRL2 registers: in this case, the FIFO_FULL_SMART bit of the
FIFO_STATUS2 register is set high when the number of samples in FIFO will reach or exceed the FTH_[10:0]
value on the next FIFO write operation.

When the trigger event occurs, two different cases can be observed:

1. If the FIFO buffer is already full (FIFO_FULL_SMART = 1), it stops collecting data at the first sample after
the event trigger. The FIFO content is composed of the samples collected before the event.

2. If FIFO buffer is not full yet (initial transient), it continues filling until it becomes full (FIFO_FULL_SMART = 1)
and then, if the trigger is still present, it stops collecting data.

Continuous-to-FIFO can be used in order to analyze the history of the samples which have generated an
interrupt; the standard operation is to read the FIFO content when the FIFO mode is triggered and the FIFO buffer
is full and stopped.

**8.2.5** **Bypass-to-Continuous mode**

This mode is a combination of the Bypass and Continuous modes previously described. In Bypass-to-Continuous
mode, the FIFO buffer starts operating in Bypass mode and switches to Continuous mode when a trigger
condition occurs.

The event condition can be one of the following:

         - Significant motion: event detection has to be configured and the INT1_SIG_MOT bit of the INT1_CTRL
register has to be set to 1;

         - Tilt: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_TILT bit of the MD2_CFG register has to be set to 1;

         - Step detection: event detection has to be configured and the INT1_STEP_DETECTOR bit of the
INT1_CTRL register has to be set to 1;

         - Single tap: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_SINGLE_TAP bit of MD2_CFG register has to
be set to 1;

         - Double tap: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_DOUBLE_TAP bit of the MD2_CFG register
has to be set to 1;

         - Free-fall: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_FF bit of the MD2_CFG register has to be set
to 1;

         - Wake-up: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_WU bit of the MD2_CFG register has to be set
to 1;

         - 6D: event detection has to be configured and the INT2_6D bit of the MD2_CFG register has to be set to 1.

Bypass-to-Continuous mode is sensitive to the edge of the interrupt signal: at the first interrupt event, FIFO
changes from Bypass mode to Continuous mode and maintains it until Bypass mode is set.

Follow these steps for Bypass-to-Continuous mode configuration (if the accelerometer / gyroscope data-ready is
used as the FIFO trigger):

1. Configure one of the events as previously described;

2. Choose the decimation factor for each sensor through the decimation bits in the FIFO_CTRL3 and
FIFO_CTRL4 registers (see Section 8.3 Setting the FIFO trigger, FIFO ODR and decimation factors for details);

3. Choose the FIFO ODR through the ODR_FIFO_[3:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL5 register.

4. Set the FIFO_MODE_[2:0] bits in the FIFO_CTRL5 register to 100b to enable FIFO Bypass-to-Continuous
mode.

**Setting the FIFO trigger, FIFO ODR and decimation factors**

**8.3** **Setting the FIFO trigger, FIFO ODR and decimation factors**

Writing data in the FIFO can be configured to be triggered by three different sources.

**Figure 32. FIFO trigger signal selection**

**F(odr) = min ( MAX(ODR_XL, ODR_G), ODR_FIFO )**


**ODR_XL**

**ODR_G**

**ODR_FIFO**














As described in Figure 32. FIFO trigger signal selection, the DATA_VALID_SEL_FIFO bit of the
MASTER_CONFIG register and the TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_DRDY bit of the FIFO_CTRL2 register are used for this

purpose:

         - If both the DATA_VALID_SEL_FIFO bit and the TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_DRDY bit are set to 0, writing data in
the FIFO is triggered by the accelerometer/gyroscope data-ready. The ODR_FIFO_[3:0] bits of FIFO_CTRL5
define the maximum data rate at which data are stored in FIFO; the latter is limited to the maximum value
between the accelerometer ODR (defined by the ODR_XL[3:0] bits of the CTRL1_XL register) and the
gyroscope ODR (defined by the ODR_G[3:0] bits of the CTRL2_G register);

         - If the DATA_VALID_SEL_FIFO bit is set to 0 and the TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_DRDY bit is set to 1, writing data
in the FIFO is triggered by step detection (corresponding to the behavior of the STEP_DETECTED bit of the
FUNC_SRC1 register): the data are stored in FIFO every time a step is detected;

         - If the DATA_VALID_SEL_FIFO bit is set to 1, writing data in the FIFO is triggered by the sensor hub
(corresponding to the behavior of the SENSORHUB_END_OP bit of the FUNC_SRC1 register), regardless
of the configuration of the TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_DRDY bit: the data are stored in FIFO when the sensor hub
routine is complete.

Using the FIFO decimation factors, data can be stored in FIFO at a rate lower than the rate of the FIFO trigger
signal. Four decimation factors can be configured, one for each FIFO data set:

         - The DEC_FIFO_G[2:0] bits of the FIFO_CTRL3 register define if the gyroscope data (associated to the 1st
FIFO data set) are stored in FIFO and the relative rate;

         - The DEC_FIFO_XL[2:0] bits of the FIFO_CTRL3 register define if the accelerometer data (associated to the
2nd FIFO data set) are stored in FIFO and the relative rate;

         - The DEC_DS3_FIFO[2:0] bits of the FIFO_CTRL4 register define if the data associated to the 3rd FIFO data
set are stored in FIFO and the relative rate;

         - The DEC_DS4_FIFO[2:0] bits of the FIFO_CTRL4 register define if the data associated to the 4th FIFO data
set are stored in FIFO and the relative rate.

**Retrieving data from the FIFO**

**8.3.1** **Procedure for ODR or FIFO configuration changes when using FIFO**

Apply the following procedure when an accelerometer/gyroscope ODR or FIFO configuration change has to be
performed:

1. Read all the data stored in the FIFO to empty it (see Section 8.4 Retrieving data from the FIFOfor details);

2. Set the FIFO in Bypass mode (set the FIFO_MODE bits of the FIFO_CTRL5 register to 000b);

3. Set the target ODR for the accelerometer and gyroscope through the ODR_XL bits of the CTRL1_XL
register and the ODR_G bits of the CTRL2_G register respectively;

4. Set the target ODR for the FIFO through the ODR_FIFO bits of the FIFO_CTRL5 register;

5. Set the gyroscope decimation factor in the DEC_FIFO_G[2:0] bits of the FIFO_CTRL3 register and the
accelerometer decimation factor in the DEC_FIFO_XL[2:0] bits of the FIFO_CTRL3 register (see Table
54. Gyroscope FIFO decimation settingand Table 55. Accelerometer FIFO decimation setting for the values
to be set in the DEC_FIFO_G[2:0] bits and the DEC_FIFO_XL[2:0] bits of FIFO_CTRL3).

6. Set the desired FIFO operating mode (see Section 8.3 Setting the FIFO trigger, FIFO ODR and decimation
factors for details).

**8.4** **Retrieving data from the FIFO**

*Note: When data are stored in the FIFO, the configuration must not be changed in order to be able to retrieve*
*data correctly.*

When FIFO is enabled and the mode is different from Bypass, reading the FIFO output registers
(FIFO_DATA_OUT_L and FIFO_DATA_OUT_H) returns the oldest FIFO sample set. Whenever these registers
are read, their content is moved to the SPI/I [2] C output buffer. FIFO slots are ideally shifted up one level in order to
release room for a new sample, and the FIFO output registers load the current oldest value stored in the FIFO
buffer.

The recommended way to retrieve data from the FIFO is the following:

1. Read the FIFO_STATUS1 and FIFO_STATUS2 registers to check how many words (16-bit data) are stored
in the FIFO. This information is contained in the DIFF_FIFO_[10:0] bits.

2. Read the FIFO_STATUS3 and FIFO_STATUS4 registers. The FIFO_PATTERN_[9:0] bits allows
understanding which sensor and which couple of bytes are being read (see Section 8.5 FIFO pattern for
more details).

3. Read the FIFO_DATA_OUT_L and FIFO_DATA_OUT_H registers to retrieve the oldest sample (16-bits
format) in the FIFO. They are respectively the lower and the upper part of the oldest sample.

The entire FIFO content is retrieved by performing a certain number of read operations from the FIFO output
registers until the buffer becomes empty (FIFO_EMPTY bit of FIFO_STATUS2 register is set high).

*Note: Once the FIFO is empty, data must not be retrieved from the FIFO_DATA_OUT_L and FIFO_DATA_OUT_H*
*registers.*

It is recommended to read faster than 1*ODR at least three times the number of the enabled FIFO data set in
order to free FIFO slots for the new data: this allows avoiding loss of data.

The rounding function (see Section 4.7 Rounding functions for details) is automatically enabled when applying a
multiple read operation to the FIFO output registers FIFO_DATA_OUT_L and FIFO_DATA_OUT_H.

**8.5** **FIFO pattern**

Data are stored in the FIFO without any tag in order to maximize the number of samples stored. To understand
which couple of data and which FIFO data set is going to be read, it is necessary to check the content of the
FIFO_PATTERN_[9:0] bits in the FIFO_STATUS3 and FIFO_STATUS4 registers.

Data are written to the FIFO with a specific pattern (for example GyroX, GyroY, GyroZ, AccX, AccY, AccZ). This
pattern changes depending on the ODRs and decimation factors assigned to the four FIFO data sets. The
FIFO_PATTERN_[9:0] bits contain a number from 0 to the index of the last sample of the pattern, then the pattern
is repeated in all FIFO content.

The first sequence of data stored in the FIFO buffer contains the data of all the enabled FIFO data sets, from the
first one to the fourth one. Then, data are repeated depending on the value of the decimation factor set for each
FIFO data set.

The examples in the next sections explain how to use the information contained in the FIFO_PATTERN_[9:0] bits.

**FIFO pattern**

**8.5.1** **Example 1**

Supposing the FIFO is storing data from the gyroscope and accelerometer at the same ODR:

         - Gyroscope ODR = 104 Hz, Accelerometer ODR = 104 Hz.

If the internal trigger (accelerometer/gyroscope data-ready) is used, it’s recommended to set the ODR_FIFO_[3:0]
bits of the FIFO_CTRL5 register to 0100b in order to set the FIFO trigger ODR to 104 Hz.

Both the DEC_FIFO_GYRO[2:0] and the DEC_FIFO_XL[2:0] fields of the FIFO_CTRL3 register have to be set to
001b (no decimation).

The following data pattern is repeated every 6 samples (each sample is represented as 16-bit data):

         - Gx Gy Gz XLx XLy XLz (gyroscope and accelerometer data)

The FIFO_PATTERN_[9:0] bits will contain a number from 0 to 5, as shown in Table 69. Example 1:
FIFO_PATTERN_[9:0] bits and next reading.

**Table 69. Example 1: FIFO_PATTERN_[9:0] bits and next reading**

|t0|2|Gz|
|t0|3|XLx|
|t0|4|XLy|
|t0|5|XLz|



**8.5.2** **Example 2**

Supposing the FIFO is storing data from the gyroscope and accelerometer at different ODRs:

         - Gyroscope ODR = 208 Hz, Accelerometer ODR = 104 Hz.

If the internal trigger (accelerometer/gyroscope data-ready) is used, it’s recommended to set the ODR_FIFO_[3:0]
bits of the FIFO_CTRL5 register to 0101b in order to set the FIFO trigger ODR to 208 Hz.

The DEC_FIFO_GYRO[2:0] field of the FIFO_CTRL3 register has to be set to 001b (no decimation applied to
gyroscope data) and the DEC_FIFO_XL[2:0] field has to be set to 010b (decimation with factor 2 applied to
accelerometer data).

Since the gyroscope ODR is twice the accelerometer ODR, the following data pattern is repeated every 9
samples (each sample is represented as 16-bit data):

         - Gx Gy Gz XLx XLy XLz Gx Gy Gz

The FIFO_PATTERN_[9:0] bits will contain a number from 0 to 8, as shown in Table 70. Example 2:
FIFO_PATTERN_[9:0] bits and next reading.

**8.5.3** **Example 3**

Supposing the FIFO is storing data from the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer at different ODRs:

         - Gyroscope ODR = 104 Hz, Accelerometer ODR = 208 Hz, Magnetometer ODR = 52 Hz.

If the internal trigger (accelerometer/gyroscope data-ready) is used, it’s recommended to set the ODR_FIFO_[3:0]
bits of the FIFO_CTRL5 register to 0101b in order to set the FIFO trigger ODR to 208 Hz.

The DEC_FIFO_GYRO[2:0] field of the FIFO_CTRL3 register has to be set to 010b (decimation with factor 2
applied to gyroscope data) and the DEC_FIFO_XL[2:0] field has to be set to 001b (no decimation applied to
accelerometer data). Assuming that the magnetometer is associated to the 3rd FIFO data set, the
DEC_DS3_FIFO[2:0] field of the FIFO_CTRL4 register has to be set to 100b (decimation with factor 4 applied to
magnetometer data).

The following data pattern is repeated every 21 samples:

         - Gx Gy Gz XLx XLy XLz Mx My Mz (gyroscope, accelerometer, mag. data - 9 samples)

         - XLx XLy XLz (accelerometer data - 3 samples)

         - Gx Gy Gz XLx XLy XLz (gyroscope and accelerometer data - 6 samples)

         - XLx XLy XLz (accelerometer data - 3 samples)

The FIFO_PATTERN_[9:0] bits will contain a number from 0 to 20, as shown in Table 71. Example 3:

**FIFO threshold**

**8.6** **FIFO threshold**

The FIFO threshold is a functionality of the LSM6DSL FIFO which can be used to check when the number of
samples in the FIFO reaches a defined threshold level.

The bits FTH_[10:0] in the FIFO_CTRL1 and FIFO_CTRL2 registers contain the threshold level. The resolution of
the FTH_[10:0] field is two bytes (1 LSB = 2 bytes, each sample is represented as 16-bit data). So, the user can
select the desired level in a range between 0 and 2047.

The bit WaterM in the FIFO_STATUS2 register represents the watermark status. This bit is set high if the number
of samples in the FIFO reaches or exceeds the watermark level (each sample is represented as 16-bit data).

FIFO size can be limited to the threshold level by setting the STOP_ON_FTH bit in the FIFO_CTRL4 register to 1.

accelerometer (or gyroscope) data are stored. The STOP_ON_FTH bit set to 0 in the FIFO_CTRL4 register. The
threshold level is set to 21 through the FTH_[10:0] bits. The WaterM bit of the FIFO_STATUS2 register rises after
the 21 [st] level has been reached (21 samples in the FIFO). Since the STOP_ON_FTH bit is set to 0, the FIFO will
not stop at the 21 [st ] sample, but will keep storing data until the FIFO_FULL_SMART flag is set high.

**High part of gyroscope and accelerometer data**

Figure 34. FIFO threshold (STOP_ON_FTH = 1) in FIFO mode shows an example of FIFO threshold level usage
in FIFO mode with the STOP_ON_FTH bit set to 1 in the FIFO_CTRL4 register; just accelerometer (or gyroscope)
data are stored in this example. The threshold level is set to 21 through the FTH_[10:0] bits and defines the
current FIFO size. In FIFO mode, data are stored in the FIFO buffer until the FIFO_FULL_SMART signal rises;
the FIFO_FULL_SMART bit of the FIFO_STATUS2 register rises when the next data stored in the FIFO will make
the FIFO full, so in this example it rises after the first 18 data (16-bit each) are stored in FIFO. The WaterM bit of
the FIFO_STATUS2 register cannot go to 1 since the FTH threshold level is never reached (data are no longer
stored in FIFO after the FIFO is full).

Figure 35. FIFO threshold (STOP_ON_FTH = 1) in Continuous mode shows an example of FIFO threshold level
usage in Continuous mode with the STOP_ON_FTH bit set to 1 in the FIFO_CTRL4 register; just accelerometer
(or gyroscope) data are stored in this example. The threshold level is set to 21 through the FTH_[10:0] bits. The

FIFO_STATUS2 register rises after the 21 [st] level has been reached (21 samples in the FIFO).

**8.7** **High part of gyroscope and accelerometer data**

It is possible to increase the number of samples stored in the FIFO by storing just the high part (8 bits) of the
gyroscope and accelerometer data. This feature is not valid for the other (external) sensors.

To the enable this feature, the bit ONLY_HIGH_DATA must be set to 1 in the FIFO_CTRL4 register. Gyroscope
and accelerometer data will be written in the FIFO at the same ODR in the order shown in Table 72. High part of
gyroscope and accelerometer data in FIFO.

**Table 72. High part of gyroscope and accelerometer data in FIFO**

|Byte 1|Byte 2|Byte 3|Byte 4|Byte 5|Byte 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Accel_X_H|Gyro_X_H|Accel_Y_H|Gyro_Y_H|Accel_Z_H|Gyro_Z_H|



When this feature is enabled, the 6 bytes containing the high part (8 bits) of the gyroscope and accelerometer
data are associated to the 1st FIFO data set and the 2nd FIFO data set is not used.

The DEC_FIFO_G[2:0] field of the FIFO_CTRL3 register has to be set to a value different from 000b (1st FIFO
data set stored in FIFO).

The DEC_FIFO_XL[2:0] field of the FIFO_CTRL3 register has to be set to 000b (2nd FIFO data set not in FIFO).

**Step counter and timestamp data in FIFO**

**8.8** **Step counter and timestamp data in FIFO**

It is possible to store timestamp and step counter data in the FIFO. These data are stored as a 4th FIFO data set
in the 6-byte data format shown in Table 73. Timestamp and pedometer data in FIFO.

         - 3 bytes for the timestamp;

         - 1 byte is not used;

         - 2 bytes for the number of steps.

**Table 73. Timestamp and pedometer data in FIFO**







|Byte 1|Byte 2|Byte 3|Byte 4|Byte 5|Byte 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|TIMESTAMP<br>[15:8]|TIMESTAMP<br>[23:16]|-|TIMESTAMP<br>[7:0]|STEPS<br>[7:0]|STEPS<br>[15:8]|


To enable this feature, the bit TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_EN must be set to 1 in the FIFO_CTRL2 register.

When this feature is enabled, the 6 bytes containing the timestamp and step counter data are associated to the
4th FIFO data set: the DEC_DS4_FIFO[2:0] field of the FIFO_CTRL4 register has to be used to define the
decimation factor.

When this feature is enabled and the DATA_VALID_SEL_FIFO bit of the MASTER_CONFIG register is set to 0,
data can be stored in the FIFO in two ways depending on the configuration of the TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_DRDY bit
in FIFO_CTRL2:

         - When the TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_DRDY bit is set to 0, data are written to the FIFO at the ODR_FIFO rate set
in the FIFO_CTRL5 register.

         - When the TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_DRDY bit is set to 1, data are stored in the FIFO every time a new step is
detected.

Follow these steps to store timestamp and pedometer data in the FIFO using either the internal trigger
(accelerometer/gyroscope data ready) or the ‘step detected’ method:

1. Turn on the accelerometer;

2. Enable the timestamp and pedometer (see Section 6.1 Pedometer functions: step detector and step counter
and Section 6.5 Timestamp);

3. Choose the decimation factor for the 4th FIFO data set through the DEC_DS4_FIFO[2:0] bits of the
FIFO_CTRL4 register;

4. Set to 1 the TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_EN bit in the FIFO_CTRL2 register;

5. Configure the bit TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_DRDY in the FIFO_CTRL2 register in order to choose the method of
storing data in the FIFO (internal trigger or every step detected);

6. If an internal trigger is used, choose the FIFO ODR through the ODR_FIFO_[3:0] bits of the FIFO_CTRL5
register. If ‘step detected’ trigger is used, no need to set the ODR_FIFO_[3:0] bits;

7. Configure the FIFO operating mode through the FIFO_MODE_[2:0] field of the FIFO_CTRL5 register.

**Temperature data in FIFO**

**8.9** **Temperature data in FIFO**

It is possible to store only temperature data as the 4th FIFO data set.

To enable this feature:

         - Bit TIMER_PEDO_FIFO_EN of the FIFO_CTRL2 register has to be set to 0;

         - Bit FIFO_TEMP_EN of the FIFO_CTRL2 register has to be set to 1.

Temperature samples (16-bit) are stored in FIFO in the 6-byte data format shown in Table 74. Temperature data in
FIFO .

**Table 74. Temperature data in FIFO**

|Byte 1|Byte 2|Byte 3|Byte 4|Byte 5|Byte 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|-|-|TEMP [7:0]|TEMP [15:8]|-|-|



Follow these steps to store 16-bit temperature data in the FIFO using the internal trigger (accelerometer/
gyroscope data-ready):

1. Turn on the accelerometer or the gyroscope;

**Temperature sensor**
## **9 Temperature sensor**

The LSM6DSL is provided with an internal temperature sensor that is suitable for ambient temperature
measurement.

If both the accelerometer and the gyroscope sensors are in Power-Down mode, the temperature sensor is off.

The maximum output data rate of the temperature sensor is 52 Hz and its value depends on how the
accelerometer and gyroscope sensors are configured:

         - If the gyroscope is in Power-Down mode:

–
the temperature data rate is equal to 12.5 Hz if the accelerometer ODR is equal to 12.5 Hz Low-Power
mode;

–
the temperature data rate is equal to 26 Hz if the accelerometer configuration is 26 Hz Low-Power
mode ;

–
the temperature data rate is equal to 52 Hz for all other accelerometer configurations.

         - If the gyroscope is not in Power-Down mode, the temperature data rate is equal to 52 Hz, regardless of the
accelerometer and gyroscope configuration.

For the temperature sensor, the data-ready signal is represented by the TDA bit of the STATUS_REG register.
The signal can be driven to the INT2 pin by setting the INT2_DRDY_TEMP bit of the INT2_CTRL register to 1.

The temperature data is given by the concatenation of the OUT_TEMP_H and OUT_TEMP_L registers and it is
represented as a number of 16 bits in two’s complement format with a sensitivity of 256 LSB/°C. The output zero
level corresponds to 25 °C.

The LSM6DSL allows swapping, by setting the BLE bit of the CTRL3_C register to 1, the content of the lower and
the upper part of the temperature output data registers (i.e. OUT_TEMP_H with OUT_TEMP_L).

Temperature sensor data can also be stored in FIFO with a configurable decimation factor (see Section
8.9 Temperature data in FIFO for details).

**9.1** **Example of temperature data calculation**

Table 75. Output data registers content vs. temperature provides a few basic examples of the data that is read
from the temperature data registers at different ambient temperature values. The values listed in this table are
given under the hypothesis of perfect device calibration (i.e. no offset, no gain error,....).

**Table 75. Output data registers content vs. temperature**

|Temperature values|Register address|Register address|Register address|Register address|
|Temperature values|OUT_TEMP_H<br>(21h)|OUT_TEMP_L<br>(20h)|OUT_TEMP_H<br>(21h)|OUT_TEMP_L<br>(20h)|
|0°C|E7h|00h|00h|E7|

**Self-test**
## **10 Self-test**

The embedded self-test functions allows checking the device functionality without moving it.

**10.1** **Accelerometer self-test**

When the accelerometer self-test is enabled, an actuation force is applied to the sensor, simulating a definite input
acceleration. In this case, the sensor outputs exhibit a change in their DC levels which are related to the selected
full scale through the sensitivity value.

The accelerometer self-test function is off when the ST[1:0] _XL bits of the CTRL5_C register are programmed to
00b; it is enabled when the ST[1:0]_XL bits are set to 01b (positive sign self-test) or 10b (negative sign self-test).

When the accelerometer self-test is activated, the sensor output level is given by the algebraic sum of the signals
produced by the acceleration acting on the sensor and by the electrostatic test-force.

The complete accelerometer self-test procedure is indicated in Figure 36. Accelerometer self-test procedure.

**AN5040**

**Gyroscope self-test**

**10.2** **Gyroscope self-test**

The gyroscope self-test allows testing the mechanical and electrical parts of the gyroscope sensor: when it is
activated, an actuation force is applied to the sensor, emulating a definite Coriolis force and the seismic mass is
moved by means of this electrostatic test-force. In this case, the sensor output exhibits an output change.

The gyroscope self-test function is off when the ST[1:0]_G bits of the CTRL5_C register are programmed to 00b;
it is enabled when the ST[1:0]_G bits are set to 01b (positive sign self-test) or 11b (negative sign self-test).

When the gyroscope self-test is active, the sensor output level is given by the algebraic sum of the signals
produced by the angular rate acting on the sensor and by the electrostatic test-force.

The complete gyroscope self-test procedure is indicated in Figure 37. Gyroscope self-test procedure.
